"Interactive effect of potassium and cadmium on growth, root morphology and chlorophyll a fluorescence in tomato plant","['Naciri, R', ' Lahrir, M', ' Benadis, C', ' Chtouki, M', ' Oukarroum, A']","A hydroponic experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of potassium (K) in tomato plant growth exposed to cadmium (Cd) stress. In this work, the effects of three potassium nutrition regimes (155, 232 and 310 ppm of K) combined with Cd at different levels (0, 12 and 25 mu M of CdCl2) on chlorophyll content index, root and shoot dry weights, root morphology, chlorophyll a fluorescence and translocation factor were analyzed. The results showed a negative effect of cadmium, at different concentrations, on all these parameters. However, optimization of K nutrition has shown promising results by limiting the negative effect of Cd. A positive effect of the high concentration of K (310 ppm) was observed on leaf chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence compared to 232 and 155 ppm under Cd stress. K supply improved the electron transport at PSI side indicated by the increase in the amplitude of the I-P phase of OJIP transient. Also, K at a concentration of 310 ppm significantly reduced Cd translocation from root to shoot and improved root and shoot growth parameters in the presence of Cd. K supplementation can reduce the negative effect of Cd by improving photosynthesis and promoting chlorophyll synthesis. The optimization of nutrients composition and concentration might be a good strategy to reduce the impact of Cd on plant growth and physiology.",[],2021.0,SCI REP-UK,['Science & Technology - Other Topics'],[''],False,1,False,63
"Natural resources revenues, agriculture development and urbanization in African countries Evidence from a static and dynamic panel data","['Azizi, J']","This paper analyzes the mechanism through which natural resource abundance leads to a poor agricultural performance and a rapid urbanization in African countries. We conducted a static and dynamic panel data analysis for a panel of 39 African countries during the period 2000-2013. Our findings show that natural resources rents have a negative impact on agricultural performance and a positive impact on food import dependency. In addition, the results show a significant positive impact of resource rents on rural-urban migration and on urbanization rate. We argue that these findings can be explained by the government choice to specialize in primary commodities to the detriment of the development of other productive sectors, especially agriculture. Because policy makers tend to invest resources rents in developing infrastructures, mostly in cities, this inevitably creates some pulling factors for rural population in search of a better life. Consequently, we observe a rapid urbanization associated with serious problems (expansion of urban slums, limited access to improved water and sanitation facilities) in many African countries, highly dependent on natural resource rents.","['Natural resources curse', ' Agriculture', ' Urbanization', ' Panel data', ' GUM', 'ECONOMIC-GROWTH', ' BOOMING SECTOR', ' CURSE', ' INSTITUTIONS', ' ABUNDANCE', ' INDUSTRIALIZATION', ' CORRUPTION', ' DEMOCRACY', ' CITIES', ' EXPORT']",2020.0,NEW MEDIT,['Agriculture'],[''],False,1,False,61
"Leja, Fejer-Leja andR-Leja sequences for Richardson iteration","['Chkifa, MA']","We study Leja sequences on the unit disc and resulting mapped sequences to conventional domain, ellipses and real intervals, for the problem of relaxation of Richardson iteration. Using simple considerations, we establish upper and lower estimates for the growth of associated Newton polynomials and the so-called residual polynomials. These results broaden the understanding of such sequences and add to results established in Calvetti et al. (Numer.

Potential End-Use of a Europium Binary Photoluminescent Ink for Anti-Counterfeiting Security Documents,"['Moudam, O', ' Lakbita, O']","Composed of two europium complexes doped in polyvinyl butyral as the host material, a novel photoluminescent ink has been formulated by synthesizing Eu(FAC)(3)Phen as a red luminescent down-shifting emitter and employing SrAl2O4:Eu, Dy as a long persistent green phosphor. Both emitters are incorporated to design a photoluminescent ink with binary emission under a single UV excitation wavelength, where a red light is emitted when exposed under 325 nm, subsequently becoming green upon the UV light being switched off. The concept presented here is unequivocally distinct from the classical dual-mode emission, which requires a second extra near-infrared excitation around 980 nm to produce a binary luminescence.

Sterile phosphate as a novel calcic adsorbent for phosphorus removal from wastewater,"['Hassoune, H', ' Lachehab, A']","Sterile phosphate (SP) was investigated for phosphorus removal from wastewater using batch adsorption experiments. The novel adsorbent is a mining by-product obtained from the phosphate mining plants having a strong affinity with phosphorus ions present in wastewater. The results of the batch adsorption experiments indicated that 30 min of contact time between the adsorbent and wastewater was sufficient for attaining equilibrium. The phosphorus removal from wastewater increased with increasing initial phosphorus concentration, adsorbent dose and temperature, while it decreased with increasing initial pH values. The maximum phosphorus removal efficiency was noted to be 94.4%. It was achieved in slightly acidic conditions (pH = 4), with an adsorbent dose and initial phosphorus concentration of 3 g L-1 and 20 mg L-1, respectively, and at room temperature. Kinetic analysis showed that phosphorus adsorption onto sterile phosphate was best fitted with the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The adsorption equilibrium data fitted well to the Langmuir model equation, indicating monolayer coverage of the adsorbent. The adsorption capacity calculated from the Langmuir model equation was found to be 7.962 mg g(-1).

A conceptual framework for platform-based design of non-assembled products,"['Lager, T']","In this study, the use of platform-based product family design of assembled products has been reconceptualised into a framework of platform-based design of non-assembled products for the process industries. As a point of departure, platform-based design is defined as shared logic in a company's activities, and a function-based leveraging strategy is employed to identify non-assembled products with similar characteristics and commonalities among product families, related production processes and raw materials. It is proposed that a production platform philosophy and platform-based design of non-assembled products should rely on Product platforms, Process platforms and Raw-material platforms that are well-integrated into common Production platforms, in an end-to-end perspective. However, platform-based design of non-assembled products may differ depending on whether company production relies solely on a captive raw material base or on purchased raw materials on the open market, or on both. The congruence of the development of Production platforms with the QFD methodology and House of Quality was noted in this study, as well as the simplicity of using the methodology on homogeneous products compared to multi-level hierarchical assembled products.

Design of hard coatings deposited by HiPIMS and dcMS,"['Ghailane, A', ' Makha, M', ' Larhlimi, H', ' Alami, J']","Hard coatings are extensively used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace and tooling industries. Hard coatings are deposited using, typically, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques. Among these, magnetron sputtering (MS) is widely used to deposit hard transition metal nitrides and oxides. In the last 20 years, technological development gave birth to a highly ionized magnetron sputtering technique called High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) that allows application tailored coating development. The present article reviews studies on the deposition of hard coatings by HiPIMS and direct current MS (dcMS).

Image Compression Based on Block SVD Power Method,"['El Asnaoui, K']","In recent years, the important and fast growth in the development and demand of multimedia products is contributing to an insufficiency in the bandwidth of devices and network storage memory. Consequently, the theory of data compression becomes more significant for reducing data redundancy in order to allow more transfer and storage of data. In this context, this paper addresses the problem of lossy image compression. Indeed, this new proposed method is based on the block singular value decomposition (SVD) power method that overcomes the disadvantages of MATLAB's SVD function in order to make a lossy image compression. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better compression performance compared with the existing compression algorithms that use MATLAB's SVD function. In addition, the proposed approach is simple in terms of implementation and can provide different degrees of error resilience, which gives, in a short execution time, a better image compression.","['Image compression', ' singular value decomposition', ' block SVD power method', ' lossy image compression', ' PSNR', 'SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION', ' ALGORITHM']",2020.0,J INTELL SYST,['Computer Science'],[''],False,1,False,27
Human Capital Index (HCI) - from uncertainty to robustness of comparisons,"['Abdelkhalek, T', ' Boccanfuso, D']","In order to monitor progress in human development within and between countries and over time, several simple and composite indices have been developed and are regularly used, particularly in public policy decision-making. In 2019, the World Bank adopted an index developed by Kraay (2018), the Human Capital Index (HCI), It combines demographic, education, and health dimensions on a complementary statistical and econometric basis. It is used by the World Bank in the area of human development for monitoring and comparison purposes, in time and space. Beyond the debate about the construction of the index itself in terms of weighting and aggregation, the HCI is subject to statistical and econometric uncertainties that are not adequately captured by comparisons and are therefore, not robust.ln this article, we propose a systematic approach taking into account these simultaneous uncertainties using a projection method. We present its practical implementation to construct confidence intervals to the HCI that reflect these uncertainties. It appears that if confidence intervals overlap for two countries or for the same country over time, then comparisons would be inconclusive regardless of the point estimates.","['Human Capital Index (HCI)', ' Uncertainty', ' Robustness', ' Comparisons', ' Projection method', 'COMPOSITE INDICATORS']",,APPL ECON,['Business & Economics'],[''],False,1,False,26

Phosphorylated cellulose paper as highly efficient adsorbent for cadmium heavy metal ion removal in aqueous solutions,"['Ablouh, EH', ' Kassab, Z', ' Hassani, FZSA', ' El Achaby, M', ' Sehaqui, H']","In search for more effective and eco-friendly adsorbent materials, this study comprehensively investigated Cd2+ adsorption onto phosphorylated cellulose paper (PCP). For this, cellulose microfibers (CMF) was extracted from Alfa fibers and phosphorylated using the solid-state phosphorylation approach. Then, the prepared PCP samples were characterized by SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, TGA, conductometric titration and zeta potential measurement. The adsorption of cadmium ions, the effect of time, pH and Cd2+ initial concentration were systematically studied in batch experiments. Based on the results, the highest adsorption capacity achieved was 479 mg of Cd2+ per g of PCP, which was remarkable compared to other modified cellulose capacities cited in the literature. Furthermore, the Cd2+ removal mechanism was investigated based on characterization results before and after adsorption and also based on the kinetics results. It was concluded that cation exchange and electrostatic attraction between phosphorylated cellulose and the cadmium ion mainly dominated the adsorption process. These findings highlighted that the phosphorylated cellulose paper has a broad application prospect in removal of divalent metal from aquatic solution.","['ADSORPTION', ' COMPOSITE', ' WATER', ' NANOCOMPOSITES', ' LEAD']",2021.0,RSC ADV,['Chemistry'],['Moroccan Kingdom'],False,1,False,46
The Readiness Index for Climate Change Adaptation in Africa: The Role of Climate and Adaptive Capacity Proxies,"['Epule, TE', ' Chehbouni, A', ' Dhiba, D', ' Moto, MW']","As global changes continue, the repercussions in Africa remain profound. This is reflected notably in food and water crises across Africa. This work examines the readiness of Africa to climate change adaptation through a newly developed readiness index (ClimAdaptCap Index). In fact, this work shifts the readiness debate from emotional descriptions that currently flood academic scholarship to a more pragmatic evidence-based approach in assessing readiness. Readiness for climate change adaptation is driven by the intensity of climate forcing and adaptive capacity. The historical climate score data or precipitation and temperature for the period 1991-2016 were culled from the World Bank Climate Portal. The historical adaptive capacity score data included proxies such as poverty and literacy rates from 1991 to 2016 were collected from the World Bank and Macrotrends. The climate data were normalized using the normalization function to enhance interpretation, comparison, and fusion into the index. Missing poverty and literacy rate data were estimated by linear interpolation of the poverty and literacy rate data. The ClimAdaptCap Index was developed to compute readiness. This index is the first of its kind and will serve as a flagship for assessing readiness for climate change adaptation as it is highly adaptable to different contexts. This work's first-ever maps of readiness show that North and Southern Africa are the readiest for climate change adaptation under historical climate and literacy and poverty conditions. West Africa is the least ready while Middle and East Africa are in the middle. Consistent is that readiness has a positive correlation with literacy rates and an inverse one with poverty rates. In addition, with readiness scores of between 0.35 and 0.39 for all the regions with a maximum potential score of 1, this work has shown that the level of readiness in Africa is generally low, and there is a very small variation between the different regions. In addition, climate change adaptation will highly be influenced by both climatic and non-climatic indicators. The developed readiness index adequately simulates readiness to climate change adaptation in Africa and complements previous frameworks of adaptation preparedness.","['readiness index', ' climate change adaptation', ' adaptive capacity', ' climadaptcap index', ' Africa', 'NORTH-AFRICA', ' SOUTH-AFRICA', ' WEST-AFRICA', ' MIDDLE-EAST', ' RAINFALL', ' WETTER', ' VULNERABILITY', ' SAHEL', ' DROUGHT', ' TRENDS']",2021.0,APPL SCI-BASEL,"['Chemistry', ' Engineering', ' Materials Science', ' Physics']",['VI'],False,1,True,47

The Islamic Civitas of three Maghribi Cities: Analytical Approach of Urban Resilience,"['Radoine, H', ' Mrani, R']","This article highlights two seemingly divergent but fundamentally related points of view. The first concerns the Islamic city as a rational product of logical progression and stratification of endogenous urban and architectural facts. The second advocates the latter as the sum of exogenous elements. Therefore, this paper demonstrates that these two visions related to the successive horizontal temporal stratification and the sinusoidal intercontinental influences are two facets of the same coin, that of the contribution to the genesis and the evolution of the Islamic civitas. However, beyond the endogenous/exogenous dichotomy, and in addition to the functional necessities, the argumentation is made around the community characteristics, intrinsic to the Islamic city, which have particularly shaped the smart urban and architectural structure of the North-African heritage. In this sense, the spatial syntax of the socio-economic dynamics of these civitates is put at the heart of the subject, in correspondence with intercultural exchanges and their impact on the aesthetic, functional and environmental urban aspects, in contrast with any systemic organization based on orthogonal projections of heterogeneous urban and architectural elements. Hence, our case study focuses as well on the constants and variables that gave rise to the territorial phenomena of Islamic cities as an ecosystem centered on socio-cultural patterns of which the individual, the family, the neighborhood and the community are the basic elements that generated durability and resilience evidenced by temporal and functional continuity.","['Resilience', ' North Africa', ' Islamic City', ' Civitas', ' Urbanism']",2021.0,HESPERIS-TAMUDA,['Arts & Humanities - Other Topics'],[''],False,1,False,22

The potential role of phosphorus (P) nutrition in the attenuation of Cd effects on photosynthetic efficiency, plant growth, and cadmium uptake has been investigated in hydroponically grown tomato. Two P nutrition regimes (P15: 15 mg l(-1); P30: 30 mg l(-1)) were assessed in the presence or absence of Cd (Cd0: 0 mu M; Cd25: 25 mu M of CdCl2). The results showed a positive effect of P30 concentration on leaf chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence compared to P15 treatment under Cd stress (Cd25). The disturbance of electron transfer caused by Cd at K and I-steps of OJIP transient was attenuated with sufficient P supply. P30 enhanced the performance index of photosystem II and the efficiency of electron transfer to electron acceptor at PSI acceptor side. Besides, increased P concentration improved root growth parameters and biomass accumulation in the presence of Cd. It was found that root tissues accumulated more Cd than shoots and Cd translocation was reduced with increasing P concentration. Our results reveal that Cd-P interaction induced a cascade of physiological and chemical changes in plants. An optimal P nutrition can attenuate Cd stress on plant by the promotion of nitrogen and potassium uptake, which in return improved photosynthesis efficiency, enhanced biomass accumulation and distribution, and minimized Cd accumulation and translocation in plant tissues.","['Photosynthetic efficiency', ' Biomass production', ' Phosphorus', ' Root morphology', ' Nutrients uptake', 'BRASSICA-JUNCEA', ' PHOTOSYSTEM-II', ' STRESS', ' PHOTOSYNTHESIS', ' ACCUMULATION', ' TOLERANCE', ' TOXICITY', ' L.', ' MECHANISMS', ' CULTIVARS']",2021.0,WATER AIR SOIL POLL,"['Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences', ' Water Resources']",[''],False,1,False,49
Wheat (Triticum aestivum) adaptability evaluation in a semi-arid region of Central Morocco using APSIM model,"['Briak, H', ' Kebede, F']","In this study, we evaluated the suitability of semi-arid region of Central Morocco for wheat production using Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) considering weather, soil properties and crop management production factors.

A quantitative statistics, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and index of agreement (d) were used in model performance evaluation. Furthermore, series of simulations were performed to simulate the future scenarios of wheat productivity based on climate projection; the optimum sowing date under water deficit condition and selection of appropriate wheat varieties. The study showed that the performance of the model was fairly accurate as judged by having RMSE = 0.13, NSE = 0.95, and d = 0.98. The realization of future climate data projection and their integration into the APSIM model allowed us to obtain future scenarios of wheat yield that vary between 0 and 2.33 t/ha throughout the study period.

Ranking Importance of Topographical Surface and Subsurface Parameters on Paludification in Northern Boreal Forests Using Very High Resolution Remotely Sensed Datasets,"['Laamrani, A', ' Valeria, O']","The accumulation of organic material on top of the mineral soil over time (a process called paludification) is common in Northern Boreal coniferous forests. This natural process leads to a marked decrease in forest productivity overtime. Topography both at the surface of the forest floor (i.e., above ground) and the subsurface (i.e., top of mineral soil which is underground) is known to play a critical role in the paludification process. Until recently, the availability of more accurate topographic information regarding the surface and subsurface was a limiting factor for land management and modeling of spatial organic layer thickness (OLT) variability, a proxy for paludification. However so far, no research has assessed which of these two topographic variables has the greatest influence on paludification. This study aims to assess which topographic variable (surface or subsurface) better explains paludification, using high-resolution remote sensing technology (i.e., Light Detection and Ranging: LiDAR and Ground Penetrating Radar: GPR). To this end, field soil measurements were made in over 1614 sites distributed throughout the reference Valrennes Experimental site in Canadian northern coniferous forests. Then, a machine learning model (i.e., Random Forest, RF) was implemented to rank a set of selected predictor topographic variables (i.e., slope, aspect, mean curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, and topographic wetness index) using the Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) index as an indicator of importance. Results showed that overall 83% of the overall variance was explained by the RF selected model, while the derived subsurface topography predictors had the lowest MDGs for predicting paludification. On the other hand, the surface slope predictor had the highest MDGs and better explained paludification. This finding would be particularly useful for implanting sustainable management strategies based on the surface variables of paludified northern boreal forests. This study has also highlighted the potential of LiDAR data to provide surface topographic spatial detail information for planning and optimizing forest management activities in paludified boreal forests. This is even of great importance when we know that LiDAR variables are easier to obtain compared to GPR derived variables (subsurface topographic variables).","['random forest model', ' forest productivity', ' forest management', ' Clay Belt', ' LiDAR', ' mineral soil', ' Subsurface Digital Elevation Model (SUB-DEM)', ' Digital Terrain Model (DTM)', 'ORGANIC LAYER', ' SOIL-MOISTURE', ' PRODUCTIVITY', ' MANAGEMENT', ' THICKNESS', ' DYNAMICS', ' CANADA', ' FIRE']",2020.0,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,"['Science & Technology - Other Topics', ' Environmental Sciences & Ecology']","['FRQNT', 'NSERC', ' Tembec Inc', 'CRE', 'NSERC']",False,5,False,36

Fortunately, 70% of our planet is covered by the seas and oceans, this area constitutes a huge potential for electricity production to be exploited. The scientific advances of recent years allow a better exploitation of these resources especially the marine current due to its reliability and predictability. The marine current energy is extracted using a hydrokinetic turbine (HKT) which transform the kinetic energy of water into an electrical energy. The exploitation of this resource needs in the first step the assessment of marine currents in the study area for implementing the HKT, and the second step is designing an adequate technology. The main goal of this study is the assessment of the marine current resource on the Moroccan Mediterranean coast to evaluate the suitable area to implement the HKT, and to determine the marine current speed intensities at different depths. As well as, to estimate an average potential existing in the site. Moreover, we will conduct a study based on the results of the assessment that was made to design a horizontal axis marine current turbine (HAMCT). Two hydrofoil profile were considered to design a HAMCT using the Blade Element Theory (BEM) and calculating their performances adapted to the site conditions Naca4415 and s8052. In addition, a comparison was made between this two HAMCT hydrofoil profile for deciding the best one for implementing in the studied area.","['Marine current resource assessment', ' Moroccan Mediterranean coast', ' Hydrokinetic turbine design', ' hydrofoil', ' BEM theory', 'GLOBAL WAVE ENERGY', ' RESOURCE ASSESSMENT', ' WIND', ' OPTIMIZATION', ' PERFORMANCE']",2021.0,ENERG EXPLOR EXPLOIT,['Energy & Fuels'],[''],False,1,False,43

Space-time localized radial basis function collocation method for solving parabolic and hyperbolic equations,"['Hamaidi, M', ' Naji, A', ' Charafi, A']","A radial basis collocation method, to solve parabolic and hyperbolic equations, based on the local space-time domain formulation is developed and presented in this paper. The method is different from those that approximate the time derivative using different formulas such as the implicit, explicit, method of lines, or other numerical methods. Considering a partial differential equation with d spatial dimensions, our technique solves the problem as a (d+1)-dimensional one without distinguishing between space and time variables, and the collocation points have both space and time coordinates. The parabolic equation is solved using the governing domain equation as a condition on the boundary characterized by the final time T. The hyperbolic equation is solved using two different methods.

User-centric analyses are useful both in terms of the socio-technical perspective on data usage within the educational domain and the positive impact that data-driven methods have. Moreover, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and process innovation has emerged due to the strategic perspectives and the process monitoring that have shown to be missing within the traditional education curricula. This study shows that there is an unprecedented increase in the amount of text-based data in different activities within the educational processes, which can be leveraged to provide useful strategic intelligence and improvement insights. Educators can apply the resultant methods and technologies, process innovations, and contextual-based information for ample support and monitoring of the teaching-learning processes and decision making.

A Unified Statistical Model for Atmospheric Turbulence-Induced Fading in Orbital Angular Momentum Multiplexed FSO Systems,"['Amhoud, E', ' Ooi, BS', ' Alouini, MS']","This paper proposes a unified statistical channel model to characterize the atmospheric turbulence induced distortions faced by orbital angular momentum (OAM) in free space optical (FSO) communication systems. In this channel model, the self-channel irradiance of OAM modes as well as crosstalk irradiances between different OAM modes are characterized by a Generalized Gamma distribution (GGD). The latter distribution is shown to provide an excellent match with simulated data for all regimes of atmospheric turbulence. Therefore, it can be used to overcome the computationally complex numerical simulations to model the propagation of OAM modes through atmospheric turbulent FSO channels. The GGD allows obtaining very simple tractable closed-form expressions for a variety of performance metrics. Indeed, the average capacity, the bit-error rate, and the outage probability are derived for FSO systems using single OAM mode transmission with direct detection. Furthermore, we extend our study to FSO systems using OAM mode diversity to improve the performance. By using a maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver, the GGD is also shown to fit the simulated combined received optical powers. Finally, space-time (ST) coding is proposed to provide diversity and multiplexing gains, and the error probability is theoretically derived under the newly proposed generic model.","['Atmospheric modeling', ' Laser beams', ' Multiplexing', ' Optical receivers', ' Optical transmitters', ' Fading channels', ' Free-space optical communication', ' orbital angular momentum', ' atmospheric turbulence', ' channel modeling', ' performance analysis', ' spatial diversity', 'SPACE-OPTICAL COMMUNICATION', ' SPATIAL DIVERSITY', ' CROSSTALK MITIGATION', ' TIME CODES', ' BEAMS', ' LIGHT', ' LINK', ' TRANSMISSION', ' PROPAGATION', ' PERFORMANCE']",2020.0,IEEE T WIREL COMMUN,"['Engineering', ' Telecommunications']",[''],False,1,False,57
What is the place of animals in the social sciences? The limits to the recent rehabilitation of animal agency,"['Guillo, D']","The socio-anthropological research that aims to rehabilitate the idea of animal agency relies on a core of recurring arguments: that until recently, the social sciences have wrongly classified animals amongst things, because they subscribed either to the animal-machine model imposed by modernity across the frontier that it sought to draw between nature and culture (Philippe Descola) or between humans and non-humans (Bruno Latour), and animals in particular (Animal Studies). The purpose of this article is to show, first, that this thesis is historically inaccurate. From the birth of the social sciences they recognized that many animals had considerable subjectivity and established their continuity with man. And far from being the result of a feature of modernity and its discourse that of science the success of the theme of the frontier between nature and culture is, on the contrary, the result of a clear rejection of the hard sciences, and particularly biology, by the social sciences of the twentieth century. This return to the past thus helps to show that these recent rehabilitations of animal agency in fact revive another frontier between the social sciences and the life sciences and thus maintain the old philosophical dualisms associated with it. In so doing, they help close a path that promises to be particularly fruitful for documenting animal agency: a dialogue without reciprocal reduction between the social sciences and the life sciences.","['ANIMAL', ' CULTURE', ' ETHOLOGY', ' GREAT DIVIDE', ' NATURALISM', ' NATURE', ' NON-HUMANS']",2015.0,REV FR SOCIOL,['Sociology'],[''],False,1,False,71

Two drying methods were performed, namely, air-drying and freeze-drying. The physical and chemical properties of the beads were characterized by different techniques (SEM, BET, FTIR, TGA/DTG). The microscopic observations show that the freeze-dried beads (AL-FD) have a smoother surface compared to the airdried beads (AL-AD); besides, they have practically conserved their initial size. The specific surface areas were found to be 0.039 m(2)/g and 56.83 m(2)/g for AL-AD and AL-FD, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of pH and adsorbent dosage, as well as the kinetic, equilibrium and thermodynamic studies, were carried out in order to elucidate the adsorption process. Results obtained showed that the kinetic sorption process follows the non-linear fitting of Avrami fractionary order model and the sorption rate decreases when decreasing the pH of the medium. The equilibrium data were well fitted by the Langmuir non-linear model for AL-AD, and described by both Langmuir and Freundlich equations in the case of AL-FD. The uptake of AL-FD was greater than AL-AD, with maximum adsorption capacities of 60.98 mg/g and 83.06 mg/g for AL-AD and AL FD, respectively. Moreover, the computed thermodynamic parameters, i.e., Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees, and Delta S degrees, suggested that the adsorption of Cd(II) onto alginate beads is an endothermic, spontaneous, and physical adsorption process.

Geopolymer Materials Based on Natural Pozzolans from the Moroccan Middle Atlas,"['Elmahdoubi, F', ' Mabroum, S', ' Hakkou, R', ' Ibnoussina, M']","The pozzolans of the Moroccan Middle Atlas are derived from a low explosive volcanism, mostly strombolian. They are mainly composed of olivine and pyroxene, presenting a less homogeneous structure (irregular vesicles). The main target of this project is to study the use of natural pozzolans (NP) and metakaolin as precursors for the production of geopolymeric binders. The characterization of raw materials and elaborated geopolymers was carried out to study their mineralogical, chemical, microstructural, and mechanical properties. The studied pozzolans and kaolin were crushed, grinded, and sifted to get a fine grain size diameter of less than 100 mu m. Then, they were calcined at 750 degrees C for 2 h to achieve an amorphous structure, increasing of their reactivity. Geopolymer production consists of mixing pozzolans and metakaolin with different amounts with an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicates. The mass proportion of metakaolin (MK) used in this study was 10%, 20%, and 30%. In the present work, the amount of metakaolin was added as a source of alumina. The elaborated geopolymers were characterized using XRD, FTIR, TGA, and SEM analyses. The compressive strength was measured at 7, 14, and 28 days. The results showed interesting mechanical proprieties at about 18 MPa at 28 days with the mixture containing 20% MK. The addition of MK showed a significant increase in mechanical properties of the elaborated geopolymer. Meanwhile, the other results confirmed the training of new phases in addition to N-A-S-H gel.

The results indicate that the use of a masking technique where the p-i-n structure was first deposited over the whole surface of a 20 cm(2) x 20 cm(2) substrate, followed by the deposition, deposits the back contact through a metal mask, and by the ultrasonic soldering of indium to access the front contact is a good alternative to laser scribing in the laboratory scale. Indeed, a record efficiency of 8.8%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.6 mA/cm(2), an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.8 V, and a fill factor of 66.07% and low resistive losses were obtained by this technique. Furthermore, a spectroscopic ellipsometry investigation of the uniformity of the film properties (thickness, band gap, and refractive index) on large-area substrates, which is crucial to mini-module fabrication on a single substrate and for heterojunction development, was performed using the optimal cell deposition recipes. It was found that the relative variations of the band gap, thickness, and refractive index n are less than 1% suggesting that the samples are uniform over the 20 cm(2) x 20 cm(2) substrate area used in this work.","['hydrogenated amorphous-silicon', ' thin-films', ' fabrication techniques', ' solar cells', ' plasma-enhanced CVD', ' electrical characterization', ' shadow masking techniques', ' film uniformity', 'THIN-FILM']",2020.0,FRONT MECH ENG-SWITZ,"['Engineering', ' Mechanics']",[''],False,1,False,18
Game-based learning and Gamification to improve skills in early years education,"['Lamrani, R', ' Abdelwahed, E']","Early childhood education has become a prevalent public policy issue. It has a serious impact on the child's personality, upbringing, education, socialization, development, and academic success from the preschool period to the university and beyond. In general, traditional teaching methods usually have a fixed learning structure which disables the child to be motivated, creative and innovative. Learners receive theoretical rather than practical instructions, which discourage them from keeping and recalling concepts and information more quickly. Moreover, traditional teaching usually lacks attracting the full attention of learners which decreases their interaction, engagement and investment in the content. Thus, the development of innovative approaches offering better education is an effective way to address this problem. On the other hand, recent researches in the fields of cognitive science and educational neuroscience show that play-based learning is a promising approach to use in early childhood education. Four key success factors for learning have been identified to strengthen children's skills, namely attention, active engagement, feedback, and consolidation. Thus, the proposed approach presents a digital play-based learning approach deploying serious games augmenting the pedagogical aspect of the Montessori approach. Our purpose is to improve children's skills in their early years education through play-based learning and gamification. It aims to provide children with a rich variety of serious gaming activities and challenging experiences in an interactive environment. We developed several serious games based on Montessori pedagogical principal and the four pillars of learning. For the evaluation, we have chosen a representative sample of children from rural regions.","['Early childhood education', ' Serious games', ' Gamification', ' Educational neuroscience', ' Pillars of learning', 'SERIOUS GAMES', ' NEUROSCIENCE', ' ENGAGEMENT', ' SCIENCE', ' TIME']",2020.0,COMPUT SCI INF SYST,['Computer Science'],[''],False,1,False,49

The governing equations consist of coupling the Navier-Stockes equation to two convection-diffusion-reaction equations for the temperature and depth of conversion under the Boussinesq approximation. A formal asymptotic analysis is performed based on the Zeldovich and Frank-Kamenetskii approach to obtain an approximate interface problem in either case. The linear stability analysis is investigated to study the resulting interface models for both cases.

Early effects of surface liming on soil P biochemistry and dynamics in extensive grassland,"['Bouray, M', ' Moir, JL', ' Condron, LM', ' Paramashivam, D']","Liming effects on soil phosphorus (P) availability via biological P cycling are not clear. We conducted an 18-month field experiment on a long-term (60 years +) permanent fertilized grassland in a relatively dry environment. The aim was to examine the impact of liming on P biochemical processes and dynamics. Lime was applied at the beginning of the experiment to produce a soil pH range of 5.4-7.0, with no fertilizer P treatments. Soil sampling was conducted throughout the experimentation period at 0-75 mm. All soils were analysed for moisture content, pH, Olsen P, resin P, exchangeable aluminium (Al), microbial biomass P (MBP) and enzyme activities. At the final sampling, the soil samples were analysed for total C, total N and anaerobic mineralizable N (AMN). A sequential P fractionation was conducted for 0-30 mm depth samples. Liming effects on soil pH and P processes were limited to the surface 30 mm only, where labile inorganic P (P-i) fraction increased by 42% at pH 7.0 compared to pH 5.4, while labile and moderately labile organic P (P-o) decreased by 33% and 25%, respectively. Strong positive relationships were found between microbial P and: soil pH, labile P-i, total C and AMN. Absolute activities of acid and alkaline phosphomonoesterases were not affected by liming. However, their specific activity decreased by 47% and 28%, respectively at pH 7.0 compared to pH 5.4. Absolute enzyme activity of phosphodiesterase correlated strongly and positively with labile P-i. Our findings demonstrate that liming enhances plant P availability under field conditions in long-term fertilized extensive grassland.

Groundwater quality forecasting using machine learning algorithms for irrigation purposes,"['El Bilali, A', ' Taleb, A', ' Brouziyne, Y']","Using conventional methods to evaluate the irrigation water quality is usually expensive and laborious for the farmers, particularly in developing countries. However, the applications of artificial intelligence models can overcome this issue through forecasting and evaluating the irrigation water quality indexes of aquifer systems using physical parameters as features. This paper aims forecasting the Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), Potential Salinity (PS), Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP), Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR), and the Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) parameters through Electrical Conductivity (EC), Temperature (T), and pH as inputs. To achieve this purpose, we developed and evaluated Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models using 520 samples of data related to fourteen Groundwater quality parameters in Berrechid aquifer, Morocco. The results revealed that the overall prediction performances of Adaboost and RF models are higher than those of SVR and ANN. However, the generalization ability and sensitivity to the inputs analyses show that the ANN and SVR models are more generalizable and less sensitive to input variables than Adaboost and RF. Globally, the developed models are valuable in forecasting the irrigation water quality parameters and could help the farmers and decision-makers in managing the irrigation water strategies.

However, there is no statistical evidence to show that the same trend holds for P fertilizers. There is a significant variation in growth between the 15 countries for all three fertilizers. For instance, Egypt and China show a higher starting level for fertilizer use in the study sample, and China's fertilizer use intensity continues to increase in all three categories of fertilizers; at the same time, Japan has been reducing its use intensity for the three categories.

The profit and cost yields per unit time are respectively assumed to be coupled through a coupling term which is the average of profit and cost yields. The corresponding system of Snell envelopes is highly complex, so we consider the aggregated yields where a mean-field approximation is used for the coupling term. First, the problem is formulated by the mean of the Snell envelope of processes. Then, in terms of backward SDEs, the problem is equivalent to a system of mean-field reflected backward SDEs with interconnected and nonlinear obstacles. More precisely, the driver function depends also on the mean of the unknown process (expected profit or cost yields) which makes the mean-field interaction in the driver nonlinear. The first main result of this paper, is to show the existence of a continuous minimal solution of the system of mean-field reflected backward SDEs, which is done by using the Picard iteration method.

Impact of Mycorrhization on Phosphorus Utilization Efficiency of Acacia gummifera and Retama monosperma under Salt Stress,"['Fakhech, A', ' Jemo, M', ' Manaut, N', ' Ouahmane, L', ' Hafidi, M']","The impact of salt stress on the growth and phosphorus utilization efficiency (PUE) of two leguminous species: Retama monosperma and Acacia gummifera was studied. The effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to mitigate salt stress was furthermore assessed.

A significant difference in mycorrhizal colonization intensity, root-to-shoot ratio, P uptake, PUE, and N uptake was observed between the legume species. Salt stress inhibited the shoot and root growth, and reduced P and N uptake by the legume species. Mycorrhizal inoculation aided to mitigate the effects of salt stress with an average increase of shoot and root growth responses by 35% and 32% in the inoculated than in the non-inoculated A. gummifera treatments. The average shoot and root growth responses were 37% and 45% higher in the inoculated compared to the non-inoculated treatments of R. monosperma.

Here, solvent-free phosphorylation of cellulose using environmentally benign and non-toxic chemicals was pursued resulting in a negatively charged material that was used to remove methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. Three different cellulose sources were selected, i.e., locally abundant Alfa grass, wood, and microcrystalline cellulose, with the aim to investigate the effect of the cellulose source on the functionalization degree and the removal efficiency of methylene blue. The poor MB adsorption capacity of native cellulose (12-40 mg g(-1)) reached exceptionally high values after phosphorylation (446-705 mg g(-1)) resulting in one of the most promising bio-based sorbents reported up-to-date. The highest phosphorylation degree was registered on cellulose from wood conferring it with the maximum adsorption properties. Curve-fitting experimental results revealed that the adsorption data were well described by the Langmuir equation and that the pseudo-second-order kinetic represents well the interactions between cellulose and MB molecules.

Such composite beads were prepared by solvent mixing technique followed by a crosslinking reaction. The obtained humid beads were dried using two approaches, namely air drying (AD) and freeze-drying (FD) and then separately used as adsorbents. All the materials investigated in this study were analyzed in terms of their structural, textural, morphological, thermal properties as well as their chemical composition and size distribution. The adsorption capacities of the as-prepared freeze-dried and air-dried composite beads toward Cd ions were evaluated in batch experiments. To optimize the adsorption conditions, the effect of adsorbent dosage, equilibrium time, Cd concentration, initial pH and temperature was evaluated and compared. It was found that the adsorption capacities of BE- and PS-filled composite beads are higher than those determined with BE and PS. The performed adsorption studies showed that the adsorption equilibrium was reached within 180 min. The pseudo-second order model can be effectively used to evaluate the adsorption kinetics and the adsorption isotherms can also be well described by the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 54.27 and 53.24 mg/g for PS- and BE-filled composites, respectively.

PGPRs like Actinobacteria can increase level of phosphate available to plants through P solubilization or mineralization. In this study we evaluated the ability of nine Phosphate Solubilizing Actinobacteria (PSA) to release P from rock phosphate (RP) and to promote maize growth and yield under in vitro and greenhouse conditions. Plate bioassay and pots culture experiment were conducted to investigate the effects of these PSA on maize plants development. High reactive rock phosphate (BG4, from Gantour phosphate mine, Morocco) and triple superphosphate (TSP) from Morocco were used as positive controls. BG4, is a reactive RP directly used to increase the P status of soil according to the Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP). For the other treatments, plants were grown in soil amended with low reactive RP obtained from the Khouribga phosphate mine (Morocco) and inoculated with selected PSA strains. Our findings have indicated that, PSA inoculation resulted in increasing of the assessed growth parameters and nutrient content in maize seedlings. Four of the tested strains (BC3, BC10, BC11 and P18) showed high performance efficiency in RP-solubilization and improved plant P nutrition and growth under low-P conditions i.e. amended with low reactive RP. Furthermore, inoculation with these latter strains also showed an important production of acid and alkaline phosphatase in the rhizosphere of the maize. The relative agronomic effectiveness (RAE) index showed that BC3(Streptomyces griseorubens) and BC11 (Norcardiopsis alba) increased the yield by 135.33 and 126.91% over the positive controls BG4. These strains can be considered as the most efficient to use rock phosphate as a crude phosphate fertilizer.

However, reports of lime-induced pH modification effects on P availability are (1) inconsistent, (2) focused mainly on chemical changes, and (3) often limited to the bulk soil. Using lupin as an indicator species, we aimed to evaluate the effects of lime-induced soil pH change, from 5.3 to 6.0, on biochemical processes responsible for P mobilization and dynamics in the rhizosphere of two different lupin species. Indicator species, blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) and Russell lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus), were grown in a P-deficient acid grassland soil without P inputs for 11 weeks in a glasshouse. The rhizosphere soils were analyzed for enzyme activity, microbial P, and carboxylates. Both bulk and rhizosphere soils were analyzed for P fractions, exchangeable aluminum (Al), and pH. Plant yields and shoot P uptake were measured. Labile inorganic P (P-i) increased in the rhizospheres of both lupin species, likely due to P-i desorption combined with labile organic P (P-o) mineralization, induced by rhizosphere pH elevation after liming. Soil pH increase promoted microbial P immobilization and reduced phosphomonoesterase activity in the rhizosphere, leading to an accumulation of P-o mainly as moderately labile and stable P-o forms. Total carboxylate concentration (TCC) increased with soil pH increase. Variation in shoot P uptake was mostly explained by TCC.

For example, the addition of phosphorus with a rate of 126 and 150 kg P2O5 center dot ha(-1) respectively improved dry matter yield by an average of 4 and 9% under low salinity level (ECw = 2 dS center dot m(-1)), by 4 and 15% under medium salinity (4 dS center dot m(-1)), and by 6 and 8% under a high salinity level (6 dS center dot m(-1)).

"Effect of salicylic acid foliar application on growth, glandular hairs and essential oil yield in Salvia officinalis L. grown under zinc stress","['Es-sbihi, FZ', ' Hazzoumi, Z', ' Joutei, KA']","Background: Generally, zinc (Zn) is an essential element and acts as a plant nutrient, but at higher concentrations, it is toxic. Higher uptake and translocation of Zn into plant tissues can cause serious physiological and biochemical alterations. However, salicylic acid (SA) is an endogenous regulator of growth and signaling molecule responsible for inducing environmental stress tolerance in plants. Therefore, spray application of SA could provide protection against several types of stresses such as Zn toxicity. In this context, the ameliorative effect of SA (0.5 and 1 mM) on Salvia officinalis L. under Zn stress (40 mM) was studied. Results: Zn stress decreased growth, chlorophyll content, essential oil yield and peltate glandular trichome density. This toxicity can be linked to a strong accumulation of Zn in the various parts of the plant. In addition, Zn stress disturbed nutrients assimilation (K, P and Ca). However, spray of SA, particularly at 0.5 mM improved all parameters studied under both Zn and normal conditions. The positive effects of SA under Zn stress condition may be due to the decrease of Zn accumulation in different parts of the plant. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in K, P and Ca content. In addition, the histological study of S. officinalis leaves showed the presence of two types of glandular hairs, the peltate and capitate glands. In the leaves of stressed plants, we noticed the presence of glands with deformations in the form of pockets in the number of one or more as well as the glands with an oval form. On the other hand, all these abnormalities glands were not detected in stressed plants that were sprayed with SA. Therefore, the absence of these anomalies under the effect of SA showed the remedial effect of this growth regulator. Conclusion: The findings of the present work suggest that spraying SA maybe useful for improving the plant growth in Zn-contaminated areas.","['Salvia officinalis', ' Zinc', ' Stress', ' Salicylic acid', ' Glandular hairs', 'BIOCHEMICAL-CHANGES', ' COPPER', ' WHEAT', ' PHOTOSYNTHESIS', ' TOLERANCE', ' SEEDLINGS', ' TOXICITY', ' ZN', ' ACCUMULATION', ' INHIBITION']",2020.0,CHEM BIOL TECHNOL AG,['Agriculture'],[''],False,1,False,73
New insight into thermocline packed bed energy storage systems: Fast algorithm for sizing,"['Baba, YF', ' Al Mers, A', ' Faik, A', ' Bouatem, A']","Several stages are involved in numerical modeling: discretization, programming, validation, and finally nu-merical resolution. Current approaches, in particular for the packed bed storage system, remain accurate; nevertheless, they require prohibitive computing time and effort. In this viewpoint, the focus of the present work is the proposition of a new algorithm for fast sizing of the packed bed energy storage systems. The methodology is based on the reduction of the dimensionless dual-phase approach developed earlier. We demonstrated how the new algorithm can be deployed efficiently for fast calculation of the essential parameters of packed bed energy storage systems. Compared to the different approaches presented in the literature, the present approach uses the required discharge time as an input parameter and considers the cycle's succession effect. The outcomes showed that the system performances can be directly predicted and correlated according to one dimensionless parameter. It demonstrates also that proposed approach significantly reduces the programming efforts as well as the central processing unit time while maintaining the dual-phase approach accuracy.

To that end, four machine learning models, namely: Support Vector Regression, k- Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are trained, validated, and compared for predicting groundwater level (GWL) at seven piezometers on alluvial groundwater of Tanobart aquifer in Morocco. The results revealed that the ANN models succeeded properly in simulating GWL at five piezometers out of the total seven piezometers considered in this study (NSE = 0.69 to 0.8); the RF was satisfactory at five piezometers (NSE = 0.41 to 0.72) and SVR at three piezometers (NSE = 0.57 to 0.81); the k-NN was the poorest model among all the investigated models (NSE = 1.05 to 0.15). The uncertainty analysis showed that the selected models are accurate overall; the SVR model showed the best forecasting accuracy with the smallest 95% interval prediction error (0.25 m and 0.11 m) at one piezometer.

It is proved that accumulation points of the sequence generated by the method are Pareto-critical points under standard assumptions.

In addition, the development process of a characteristic Layer Adsorption Filtration System (LAFS) community is favoured by the special properties of MBRs. This study will study the operating and treatment performance of MBR and infiltration processes and compare them with each other. The calculation was made using GPS-X software.

Assessing the impact of parameters tuning in ensemble based breast Cancer classification,"['Idri, A', ' Bouchra, E', ' Hosni, M', ' Abnane, I']","Breast cancer is one of the major causes of death among women. Different decision support systems were proposed to assist oncologists to accurately diagnose their patients. These decision support systems mainly used classification techniques to categorize the diagnosis into Malign or Benign tumors. Given that no consensus has been reached on the classifier that can perform best in all circumstances, ensemble-based classification, which classifies patients by combining more than one single classification technique, has recently been investigated. In this paper, heterogeneous ensembles based on three well-known machine learning techniques (support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, and decision trees) were developed and evaluated by investigating the impact of parameter values of the ensemble members on classification performance. In particular, we investigate three parameters tuning techniques: Grid Search (GS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the default parameters of the Weka Tool to evaluate whether setting ensemble parameters permits more accurate classification in breast cancer over four datasets obtained from the Machine Learning repository. The heterogeneous ensembles of this study were built using the majority voting technique as a combination rule. The overall results obtained suggest that: (1) Using GS or PSO techniques for single techniques provide more accurate classification; (2) In general, ensembles generate more accurate classification than their single techniques regardless of the optimization techniques used. (3) Heterogeneous ensembles based on optimized single classifiers generate better results than the Uniform Configuration of Weka (UC-WEKA) ensembles, and (4) PSO and GS slightly have the same impact on the performances of ensembles.","['Breast cancer', ' Ensemble', ' Machine learning', ' Classification', ' Optimization techniques', 'SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE', ' SOFTWARE', ' PREDICTION', ' DIAGNOSIS', ' ACCURACY']",2020.0,HEALTH TECHNOL-GER,['Medical Informatics'],[''],False,1,False,79
Arthrophytum scoparium Extract Improves Memory Impairment and Affects Acetylcholinesterase Activity In Mice Brain,"['Smach, MA', ' Hafsa, J', ' Charfeddine, B', ' Dridi, H', ' Limem, K', ' Jihene, B']","Background: Arthrophytum scoparium (Pomel) Iljin (Amaranthaceae family) has been widely used in traditional Tunisian medicine to treat many disorders such as migraine, headache, and neurological disorders. This study investigates the effect of Arthrophytum scoparium Aqueous Extract (ASAE) on cognitive impairments and oxidative injury induced by galactose (10%) in a mouse model. Materials and Methods: The mice were divided randomly into 4 experimental groups, including the control group (saline water 9 parts per thousand), Galactose group, Scop group (300 mg/kg/d), and Scop-+-Gal group (300 mg/kg/d). Mice received the corresponding solutions by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) for 7 days before the Y-maze active tests. Galactose 10% was given to all groups except control and Scop groups, 30 min before the trial. Levels of Acetylcholinesterase Activity (AChE), Ascorbic Acid (AA), Gluthatione (GSU) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) in mice brains were examined. Results: Chronic administration of galactose significantly impaired cognitive performance in Y maze, caused marked oxidative damages and a significant increase in the acetylcholinesterase activity as compared to other groups. On the contrary, ASAE (300 mg/kg) treatment suppressed galactose-induced oxidative damage by meliorating the increased levels of GM and AA. Moreover, ASAE treatment reduced brain AChE activities in the galactose-induced model.

The hydrolysis was performed at 64% acid concentration, a temperature of 50 degrees C and at two different hydrolysis times, 15 min (CNC15) and 30 min (CNC30). It was found that CNC exhibited a diameter of 9 +/- 3 nm and 5 +/- 2 nm, a length of 354 +/- 101 nm and 329 +/- 98 nm, a crystallinity of 75% and 87%, a surface charge density of similar to 1.57 and similar to 1.88 sulfate groups per 100 anhydroglucose units and a zeta potential value of -25.6 and -30.7 mV, for CNC15 and CNC30, respectively. The thermal degradation under nitrogen atmosphere started at 225 degrees C (CNC15), which is relatively higher than the temperature for sulfuric acid hydrolyzed CNC from other sources. Due to a high importance of CNC application in aqueous systems, the rheological behaviour of CNC suspensions at various concentrations was evaluated by the steady shear viscosity measurements and the oscillatory dynamic tests. The results showed that the CNC suspensions exhibited a gel-like behaviour at very low CNC concentrations (0.1-1%) wherein a strong CNC entangled network is formed.

Performance Analysis of Large Scale Grid Connected PV Plants in the MENA Region,"['Touili, S', ' Merrouni, AA', ' El Hassouani, Y', ' Amrani, AI']","This study is an attempt to investigate the potential of electricity production from large scale Photovoltaic (PV) plants in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

Those locations are well distributed in the region and they have a GHI (Global horizontal irradiation) values between 1683,01 and 2445,39 kWh/m(2)/year. After that, in order to evaluate and benchmark the region's PV performance and capacity production, the simulation results of the 100 MWp plant were compared with those simulated under the climate of the US and Spain for the same plant configuration. The results show that the average yearly electricity production from the 100 MWp plant in MENA is around 158 GWh/year, while the same configuration produces 155,8 GWh/year and 155,4 GWh/year if installed in Almeria, Spain and Bakersfield California respectively.

Data-driven polynomial chaos expansions for characterization of complex fluid rheology: Case study of phosphate slurry,"['El Mocayd, N', ' Seaid, M']","Mine transportation through hydraulic pipelines is increasingly used by various industries around the world. In Morocco, this has been implemented for the case of phosphate transportation. This allows to increase the production and reduce the transportation cost. Given the vital importance of phosphate in the global food security and regarding the huge amount of phosphate rock reserves in Morocco, it is detrimental to assess the reliability, to optimize and to increase its transportation in a safe manner. Usually hydraulic transportation of such fluids is fully quantified with a full characterization of its rheology related to its non-Newtonian behavior. The rheology allows to know the viscous and the elastic properties of a fluid exhibiting viscoelastic properties. In the case of water-phosphate slurry this behavior is not well-documented and classical constitutive laws for the rheology are of limited used, because of the high variability of different physico-chemical components of the slurry. The present work aims at quantifying the sensitivity of the water-phosphate slurry rheology to these components. In order to achieve this objective, a data-driven model based on polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) is developed and investigated. The choice of this class of models is motivated by the simplicity to conduct sensitivity analysis with the PCE and the limited amount of data available as the water-phosphate slurry pipeline is very new. In order to alleviate further the impact of the limitation given by the available data, we introduce the bagging technique which is an Ensemble based data-driven model using the PCE. Results presented in this study demonstrate that the bagging allows to reduce the validation error of the model by up to two orders of magnitude. Thus, it reduces considerably the variability on the estimation of hyperparameters in the model. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis shows that the variability on the elasticity coefficient is mainly due to the variability of the slurry density and the solid rate. Viscosity on the other side is not affected by the heterogeneity of the granulation distribution.","['Data-driven modeling', ' Polynomial chaos expansion', ' Rheology', ' Bagging', ' Phosphate slurry', ' Machine learning', ' Sensitivity analysis', 'CONSTITUTIVE-EQUATIONS', ' SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS', ' UNCERTAINTY', ' SURROGATES']",2021.0,RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE,"['Engineering', ' Operations Research & Management Science']",['OCP'],True,1,False,62

We performed a dose-response experiment using P as the limiting nutrient, and maize (Zea mays L.) as a plant-test. After 45 d of growth, we evaluated the effects of P fertilization in total maize shoot biomass, P shoot accumulation, leaf pigment quantification by UV-Vis, and the evaluation of biochemical variations by DRIFT spectroscopy analysis associated with a chemometric approach in the same leaf extract used for pigment quantification. P fertilization raised biomass accumulation (similar to 7.4x), P uptake (similar to 2.3x), and total chlorophyll a and b contents (similar to 2.1x).

Analysis of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Inoculant Benchmarks,"['Basiru, S', ' Mwanza, HP', ' Hijri, M']","Growing evidence showed that efficient acquisition and use of nutrients by crops is controlled by root-associated microbiomes. Efficient management of this system is essential to improving crop yield, while reducing the environmental footprint of crop production. Both endophytic and rhizospheric microorganisms can directly promote crop growth, increasing crop yield per unit of soil nutrients. A variety of plant symbionts, most notably the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and phosphate-potassium-solubilizing microorganisms entered the era of large-scale applications in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. The purpose of this study is to compile data to give a complete and comprehensive assessment and an update of mycorrhizal-based inoculant uses in agriculture in the past, present, and future. Based on available data, 68 mycorrhizal products from 28 manufacturers across Europe, America, and Asia were examined on varying properties such as physical forms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal composition, number of active ingredients, claims of purpose served, mode of application, and recommendation. Results show that 90% of the products studied are in solid formula-powder (65%) and granular (25%), while only 10% occur in liquid formula. We found that 100% of the products are based on the Glomeraceae of which three species dominate among all the products in the order of Rhizophagus irregularis (39%), Funneliformis mosseae (21%), Claroideoglomus etunicatum (16%). Rhizophagus clarus is the least common among all the benchmark products. One third of the products is single species AMF and only 19% include other beneficial microbes. Of the sampled products, 44% contain AMF only while the rest are combined with varying active ingredients. Most of the products (84%) claimed to provide plant nutrient benefits. Soil application dominates agricultural practices of the products and represents 47%. A substantial amount of the inoculants were applied in cereal production. Recommended application doses varied extensively per plant, seed and hectare. AMF inoculant seed coating accounted for 26% of the products' application and has great potential for increased inoculation efficiency over large-scale production due to minimum inoculum use. More applied research should also be conducted on the possible combination of AMF with other beneficial microbes.","['arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi', ' bioinoculants', ' biostimulants', ' biofertilizers', ' crop production', ' inoculant formulation', ' field applications']",2021.0,MICROORGANISMS,['Microbiology'],"['OCP', 'VI']",True,2,True,83
Efficient second-order semi-implicit finite element method for fourth-order nonlinear diffusion equations,"['Keita, S', ' Beljadid, A', ' Bourgault, Y']","We focus here on a class of fourth-order parabolic equations that can be written as a system of second-order equations by introducing an auxiliary variable. We design a novel second-order fully discrete mixed finite element method to approximate these equations. In our approach, we propose new techniques using the second-order backward differentiation formula for the time derivative and a special technique for the approximation of nonlinear terms. The use of the proposed technique for nonlinear terms makes the developed numerical scheme efficient in terms of computational cost since the proposed method only deals with a linear system at each time step and no iterative resolution is needed. A numerical convergence study is performed using the method of manufactured and analytical solutions of the system where we investigate different boundary conditions. With respect to the spatial discretization, convergence rates are found to at least match a priori error estimates available for linear problems. The convergence analysis is completed with an investigation of the temporal discretization where we numerically demonstrate the second-order time-accuracy of the proposed scheme using the method of reference solution. We present a series of numerical tests to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this sense, it is of high interest to understand who are the biochemical and structural features of the lignocellulosic biomass, which affect the Specific Energy Requirement (SER), and in consequence the cost of mechanical size reduction processes. First, it was shown that the initial moisture content of the lignocellulosic biomass affect the SER and the final particle size distribution. The highest the moisture content gives raise the highest SER. Then, at fixed initial moisture content (approximate to 7% DW), structural and biochemical features of lignocellulosic biomass that can affect the SER were determined.

Perception gaps that may explain the status of taro (Colocasia esculenta) as an orphan crop,"['Matthews, PJ', ' Ghanem, ME']","Societal Impact Statement Using Taro (Colocasia esculenta) as a case study, we examine how perception gaps contribute to negative feedback loops that create or maintain the orphan status of certain crops. For students and researchers seeking uncrowded areas for study, orphan crops and crop-wild-relatives offer large open spaces, figuratively and literally. Learning how to see what has not been seen may in turn help us to reduce our global dependence on very few crops, and the risks that follow from this. The combination of climate change and variability and increasing population has painted a dark picture of future food security for many regions in the world where resources are scarce. The key to future food and nutrition security may very well lie in unlocking the untapped potential of orphan and overlooked crops. SummaryThe present distribution of taro (Colocasia esculenta), as a cultivated food plant, extends from southern to northern Africa, western Asia to eastern Asia, throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, and through the Americas, from the USA to Brazil. Despite its vast geographical range, high nutritional value, and considerable trade as a fresh and processed crop, there has been relatively little interest in taro and its wild relatives among research funding agencies, and little effective or large-scale assessment of production, trade and usage. Given the proven ability of this crop to grow under diverse climatic regimes, from the equatorial tropics to northern and southern temperate zones it may be useful to consider perception gaps that contribute to disregard of the crop. Here we suggest and discuss a range of perception gaps that together may explain the status of taro as an orphan crop. Perception gaps exist because of many factors: dogma, linguistic diversity, social biases, under-research, limited physical visibility of living wild populations, poor archaeological visibility, missing production numbers and inaccurate distribution maps. These contributing factors are shared, to lesser or greater extent, by many other orphan crops, but the disjunction between actual utilization (significant) and research effort (minimal) may be greater for taro than for most other orphans.","['Colocasia esculenta', ' gap', ' orphan crop', ' perception', ' taro', 'FOOD', ' CULTIVATION', ' HIGHLANDS', ' ACRIDITY', ' PLANTS', ' ROOT', ' YAM']",2021.0,PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,"['Biodiversity & Conservation', ' Plant Sciences', ' Environmental Sciences & Ecology']","['National Museum of Ethnology, Japan', 'JSPS']",False,2,False,94
Intra-day Variability Quantification from Ground-Based Measurements of Global Solar Irradiance,"['El Alani, O', ' Ghennioui, H', ' Ghennioui, A']","Worldwide electricity production has switched from fossil fuel combustion to renewable energy sources and solar power generation has increased significantly in recent years, particularly in the form of photovoltaic (PV) power. Solar radiation is mainly influenced by the process of sunlight interaction with clouds. Being able to quantify the variability of solar irradiance due to clouds is crucial for better integration of the energy generated in the power grid by reducing the uncertainties in solar irradiance forecasts. Our objective is the characterization of a given solar site by quantifying the variability of solar irradiance caused by clouds. To do so, we provide a classification scheme of clouds conditions classes based on the daily clear sky index K-c, and the hourly intraday variability delta(K-c) defined by the standard deviation of the variations of the clear sky index. As a result of irradiance classification, we obtained nine classes identified as the clear sky (A), mixed (B), and overcast (C) conditions and subdivided into three categories: low (I), medium (II), and high variability (III). We used the solar irradiance data set measured at the high precision meteorological station installed in Benguerir, Morocco, for the period from 01/01/2018 to 31/12/2018. We found that clear sky conditions with low variability (class AI) are the most frequent with a percentage of (38%). Followed by clear sky conditions with medium variability (AII) and mixed sky conditions with medium variability (BII) with a percentage of 18.27% and 19.23% respectively.

Modelling company generic production capabilities in process industries A configuration approach,"['Lager, T', ' Samuelsson, P', ' Storm, P']","Purpose In the process industries, it is essential to have a well-articulated manufacturing strategy within companies. However, to facilitate manufacturing strategy development, it is important to start with a good characterisation of the material transformation system and company production capabilities. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A grounded theory approach, with inspiration from configuration modelling, attempted to characterize the material transformation system as a set of variables. The variable development was based on a literature review and the knowledge base of five industry experts. Two exploratory mini-case studies were carried out, primarily to illustrate the use of the model, but additionally to test its industrial usability. Findings - A set of 31 variables was developed, and related measures and scales were tentatively defined. Two mini-cases supported the usability of the model. The model, focussing on company generic process capabilities, is a conceptual taxonomy and the study's theoretical contribution. Research limitations/implications - The lucidity of the definitions and scales for the variables are open to further refinement, and the limited discussions of variable relationships in this study are addressed in an agenda for further research. Practical implications - The model can be deployed as a facilitative instrument in the analysis of company material transformation systems and may serve as a platform in further discussions on companies' strategy development. Originality/value - The model is a new instrument for analysing company generic process capabilities and an effort to build new theory rather than to test an existing one.","['Manufacturing strategy', ' Grounded theory', ' Configuration modelling', ' Process industries', 'OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', ' RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', ' MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY', ' STRATEGY', ' ORDER', ' PERSPECTIVES', ' PERFORMANCE', ' CONSTITUTES', ' CUSTOMER', ' TAXONOMY']",2017.0,INT J OPER PROD MAN,['Business & Economics'],[''],False,1,False,85
"Seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers from semi-arid environments, Case of the alluvial aquifer of Essaouira basin (Morocco)","['Ouhamdouch, S', ' Bahir, M', ' Ouazar, D']","Marine intrusion phenomenon is the main phenomenon threatening the groundwater quality in coastal aquifers around the world. This phenomenon is generally caused by the overexploitation of aquifers, decline in the piezometric level and the rise in sea level under the climate change effect. There are several approaches to study and assess the marine intrusion phenomenon. For this study, the crossing of piezometric, hydrochemical and isotopic approaches was adopted to highlight the state of this phenomenon within the Plio-quaternary aquifer of the Essaouira basin. The couples (Na, Cl), (Ca, Mg), (Br, Cl), (delta H-2, delta O-18), (delta O-18, Cl) were determined for 24 samples capturing the shallow aquifer of the Essaouira basin. The piezometric approach shows that negative piezometric levels are registered. The ionic ratios Br/Cl close to 1.5 and 1.7 parts per thousand, Na/Cl close to 0.86, Mg/Ca and SO4/Cl weak showed that the seawater begins to invade the freshwater of the Plio-quaternary aquifer of Essaouira basin. This intrusion demonstrated by ionic ratios and corroborated by isotopic approach and the combined use of oxygen-18 contents and chlorides has a mixing rate of 15.9% at the well 11/51, 14.5% at the sample 45/51, 13.2% at the well 149/51, 13.3% at point O114 and 12.8% at the well O94.

We first perform a formal asymptotic analysis in the limit of a large activation energy to get an approximate interface problem. Then, we fulfill the linear stability analysis of the stationary solution and find the perturbation equations. A meshless collocation method based on multiquadric radial basis functions has been applied for numerical simulations. The conditions of convective instabilities obtained are in good agreement with some previous studies. This shows that the proposed approach is accurate and that it helps in describing the influence of the propagation direction on stability of polymerization fronts.","['Polymerization front', ' natural convection', ' asymptotic analysis', ' linear stability analysis', ' multiquadric radial basis functions method']",2019.0,COMMUN FAC SCI UNIV,['Mathematics'],[''],False,1,False,13

The obtained QSAR models using multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS) methods showed a high correlation between the experimental activity and the predicted one by PLS (R-PLS(2)=0.82, q(2)=0.72) and MLR (R-MLR(2)=0.82, q(2)=0.72).

This paper conducts a Structured Literature Review (SLR) of the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Image Processing (IP) techniques to deal with BC imaging. A set of 530 papers published between 2000 and August 2019 were selected and analyzed according to ten criteria: year and publication channel, empirical type, research type, medical task, machine learning techniques, datasets used, validation methods, performance measures and image processing techniques which include image pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and feature selection. Results showed that diagnosis was the most used medical task and that Deep Learning techniques (DL) were largely used to perform classification. Furthermore, we found out that classification was the most ML objective investigated followed by prediction and clustering. Most of the selected studies used Mammograms as imaging modalities rather than Ultrasound or Magnetic Resonance Imaging with the use of public or private datasets with MIAS as the most frequently investigated public dataset. As for image processing techniques, the majority of the selected studies pre-process their input images by reducing the noise and normalizing the colors, and some of them use segmentation to extract the region of interest with the thresholding method. For feature extraction, we note that researchers extracted the relevant features using classical feature extraction techniques (e.g. Texture features, Shape features, etc.) or DL techniques (e. g.

Due to the adverse health effects of these ions (dental and bone fluorosis), the World Health Organization (WHO) has set the maximum permissible concentration in drinking water at 1.5 mg/L. The objective of this work is to study the influence of initial concentration and pressure on the removal of fluoride (F-) ions by nanofiltration (NF) from groundwater doped with NaF. Three membranes are tested namely NF90, NF270 and TR60. To understand the transfer mechanisms in these three NF membranes and for different initial concentrations, the solute flow by convection and the flow by diffusion are calculated. In addition, two mathematical models are used. The Spiegler-Kedem model is applied to determine the reflection coefficient sigma and the solute permeability coefficient P-s at different initial concentrations. The Steric Hindrance Pore (SHP) model is applied to determine the mean pore radius for the membranes studied. The results show that there is no significant effect of the initial concentration and the applied pressure on the concentration of fluoride ions in the permeate for the NF90 membrane. On the other hand, the other two membranes NF270 and TR60, exhibit similar behaviors with respect to fluoride ions. A value exceeding the allowed limit of F- is observed from 6 ppm for NF270 and from 5 ppm for TR60. The C-conv and J(diff) increase with the increase in the initial concentration of fluoride ions.

Hydraulic behavior variation of pervious concrete due to clogging,"['Sandoval, GFB', ' Galobardes, I', ' De Moura, AC', ' Toralles, BM']","During the rainfall, different types of sediments are transported (organic and inorganic) and can end up decreasing the hydraulic efficiency of Pervious Concrete (PC). This phenomenon is known as clogging and occurs naturally in the PC due to its high area exposed to the weather. This study aims to identify and characterize the phenomenon of clogging in PC with natural aggregates and recycled aggregates, subjected to three types of sediment: two types of sand (Sand 1 and Sand 2, respectively) and a mixture of sand and clay (S + C). Besides, this research aims on proposing a maintenance plan to avoid loss of functionality of structures produced with PC. To fulfil these aims, the constant head permeability test will be adapted to evaluate the variation of permeability (k) during the clogging process. The results show that PC with recycled aggregates have the best hydraulic performance when compared with PC with natural aggregates.

Regarding clogging phenomenon, natural aggregate PC presents permeability reductions of 50 % (Sand 2), 60 % (S + C) and 70 %, (Sand 1) whereas in the case of recycled aggregate the maximum reduction was 30 % (S + C), 40 % (Sand 1) and 50 % (Sand 2). These results show the hydraulic advantage of implementing the use of recycled aggregates for PC production. On the other hand, the results show that a maintenance cycle of 5 years would make possible an increasing of the hydraulic life of PC independently of the type of aggregate used.

Feasibility of electrodialysis in heavy metals removal from brassware wastewaters,"['Benalla, S', ' Bachiri, B', ' Touir, J', ' Tahaikt, M', ' Taky, M', ' Touhami, ME', ' Elmidaoui, A']","The surface treatment workshops (brassware) are among the artisanal specialties of the city of Fez, which generate toxic and harmful effluents. In fact, the large amount of produced effluents is rich in heavy metals. Hence it is necessary to treat these effluents before returning them to the natural environment or for reuse. In the brassware workshops, the production of craft items passes through a chain of surface treatment and rinsing baths. Various rinsing baths are used: degreasing baths, alkaline copper-plating baths, acid copper-plating baths, nickel-plating baths and silver-plating baths. These rinsing baths are loaded with heavy metals (copper, silver and nickel). In order to treat these effluents to comply with the discharge limit values, the Ministry of Tourism, Crafts of Air Transport and Social Economy and Ibn Tofail University have agreed to launch a research collaboration to study the feasibility of membrane-based processes - electrodialysis (ED), nanofiltration and reverse osmosis - in the treatment of these effluents. This first study aims to investigate the removal of heavy metals from rinsing baths by ED. Two couples of ion-exchange membranes have been tested ACS/CMX and AXE/CMX. Using the selected couple of ion-exchange membranes (CMX/AXE), the treatment by ED of mixing of all rinsing baths, brassware wastewater loaded with copper, silver, nickel is performed.

In fact, the main objective is no longer to replace humans but to enhance their capabilities, which is why Artificial Intelligence is now referred to as Intelligence Augmentation. In this context, interpretability is used to help domain experts learn new patterns and machine learning experts debug their models. This paper aims to investigate three black-boxes interpretation techniques: Feature Importance, Partial Dependence Plot, and LIME when applied to two types of feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks: Multilayer perceptrons, and Radial Basis Function Network, trained on the Wisconsin Original dataset for breast cancer diagnosis. Results showed that local LIME explanations were instance-level interpretations that came in line with the global interpretations of the other two techniques.

Spatialized flood resilience measurement in rapidly urbanized coastal areas with a complex semi-arid environment in northern Morocco,"['Satour, N', ' Raji, O', ' El Mocayd, N', ' Kacimi, I', ' Kassou, N']","Enhancing resilience is critical for coastal urban systems to cope with and minimize flood disaster risks. This issue is certainly more important in Africa, where the increase in flood frequency is a significant concern for many areas. In this context, urban planners need accurate approaches to set up a standard for measuring the resilience to floods. In Morocco, this issue is still not fully covered by the scientific community despite the obvious need for a new approach adapted to local conditions. This study applied a composite index and geographic-information-system approach to measure and map resilience to floods in three northern coastal municipalities. The approach is also based on a linear ranking of resilience parameters, offering a more optimal classification of spatial resilience variation. The results allowed us to identify specific areas with different resilience levels and revealed the relationship between urban dimensions and the flood resilience degree.

An Investigation into the Applicability of Pyrolyzed Tyre Char and Tyre Crumb for the Recovery of Gold from Acidic Solutions,"['Maapola, P', ' Iraola-Arregui, I', ' du Preez, L', ' Okoro, OV', ' Gorgens, JF']","The present study has assessed the performance of pyrolytic tyre char and tyre crumb as cheap adsorbents for gold recovery from acidic solutions. The performances of the aforementioned cheap adsorbents, prior to and after undertaking demineralisation operations, were also investigated. Demineralisation of the adsorbents was undertaken via the application of 1 M sodium hydroxide and 1M nitric acid at a temperature of 90 degrees C for a duration of 24 h with changes in BET surface areas (S-BETs) and adsorption performances, subsequently evaluated. Initial investigations established that the pH value of 2 constituted the preferred pH at which adsorption was enhanced, thus this pH was maintained while undertaking subsequent kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments. Based on the experimental investigations, it was demonstrated that the kinetics and adsorption of gold ions (Au3+) as AuCl(4)(-)anions from acidic solutions was best described using pseudo second order kinetic and Langmuir equilibrium isotherm models, respectively. Even though the demineralisation process resulted in a notable increase in BET surface areas (S-BETs) for both char (23%) and crumb (984%), it was found to negatively influence adsorbent loading of Au(3+)ions onto the adsorbents. It was therefore suggested that sulphur removal via demineralisation may explain the reduced adsorbent loading since there is typically an affinity of gold ions (Au3+) for localised elemental sulphur. This affinity causes sulphur to be oxidised into solution and the gold ions (Au3+) to be reduced to elemental gold on the adsorbent surface. The present study was therefore able to demonstrate the preference for untreated of pyrolytic tyre char and to a lesser extent, untreated crumb, as alternative low-cost adsorbents for gold recovery from acidic solutions.

The best agronomic practices such as fertilization are used to cope with salinity stress and improve productivity under saline conditions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the interactive effect of phosphorus and salinity on sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cv. Sporta productivity and quality. A field experiment was carried out, testing three levels of irrigation water salinity (ECw = 0.7; 4, 8, and 12 dS.m(-1)) and three levels of phosphorus (100, 120, and 140 kg P2O5.ha(-1)) organized in a split-plot design with three replicates. This research was conducted in the Tadla region (center of Morocco) during two seasons in 2019 and 2020. The obtained results show that irrigation water salinity had a negative effect on most growth and productivity parameters. For instance, sugar beet yield reduced by 21% and by 26% under saline irrigation, with an EC value equal to 4 and 8 dS.m(-1), respectively, compared to the control during the 2018-2019 season, and by 1%, 19%, and 27% under saline irrigation, with an EC value equal to 4 and 8 and 12 dS.m(-1), respectively compared to the control (0.7 dS.m(-1)) during the 2019-2020 season. Total sugar content was significantly increased by 5% and 7%, respectively, under saline irrigation, with an EC value of 4 and 8 dS.m(-1), respectively, as compared with the control in the first growing season in 2018-2019. However, in the second growing season (2019-2020), only the highest level of saline water (EC = 12 dS.m(-1)) significantly increased in sugar content by 15% compared to the control. Regarding the P fertilization effect, it was found that a P rate of 120 kg P2O5.ha(-1) was enough to improve the yield and sugar content of sugar beet under the tested salinity levels. Thus, P fertilization could be one of the best practices to enhance sugar beets' tolerance of salinity. To obtain a maximum root and sugar yield under saline water, it is recommended to apply a phosphorus dose of 120 kg P2O5.ha(-1).","['stomatal conductance', ' yield', ' quality', ' root development', ' sugar content', 'OSMOTIC ADJUSTMENT', ' SALT-TOLERANCE', ' SOIL PROPERTIES', ' PLANT-GROWTH', ' STRESS', ' ROOT', ' WATER', ' IRRIGATION', ' BARLEY', ' YIELD']",2021.0,AGRONOMY-BASEL,"['Agriculture', ' Plant Sciences']",['OCP'],True,1,False,62

The geopolymers were manufactured using metakaolin as a raw material with Sodium hexafluorosilicate Na(2)SiF(6)powder as an additive, and a mixture composed of NaOH, KOH, and sodium silicate together as an activating solution. The amount of Na(2)SiF(6)ranged from 1 to 5%, a (SiO2/ (Na2O + K2O)) modulus of 1.3 and a Si/Al ratio varied between 1.60 and 1.70.

The findings indicate that the addition of 2% Na(2)SiF(6)improves the compressive strength by 28%, but beyond this value, the resistance progressively decreases, this observation was explained by the fact that this additive rises the Si/Al ratio, which led to an increase in the amount of strong Si-O-Si bonds.

The greatest constraints of seawater desalination remain its energy consumption per cubic meter of produced water and the environmental impacts due to the discharge of brines into the natural environment. Despite the many advantages of desalination, its environmental impact, therefore, remains a major concern. Its advantages and drawbacks must be assessed in terms of costs and benefits, societal and environmental aspects, and compared to other freshwater production processes. The objective of this work is twofold. Firstly, the objective is to present thoroughly a bibliographic study on water desalination by highlighting the problems related to energy consumption, fouling and brine management. With an aim to provide an insight on the cost of desalination, this review collates different research studies which evaluate and compare the economic cost of the produced water by three based-membranes processes, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis and electrodialysis, for seawater and brackish water desalination.

"Characterization of mechanisms and processes controlling groundwater salinization in coastal semi-arid area using hydrochemical and isotopic investigations (Essaouira basin, Morocco)","['Bahir, M', ' Ouazar, D', ' Ouhamdouch, S']","The aquifer system of Essaouira basin is recognized as one of the most important aquifers in Morocco. The purpose of this study is to highlight the origin and the mechanisms responsible for the salinization of this aquifer system, thus based on the two hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches.

Deep hybrid architectures for binary classification of medical breast cancer images,"['Zerouaoui, H', ' Idri, A']","The diagnosis of breast cancer in the early stages significantly decreases the mortality rate by allowing the choice of adequate treatment. This study developed and evaluated twenty-eight hybrid architectures combining seven recent deep learning techniques for feature extraction (DenseNet 201, Inception V3, Inception ReseNet V2, MobileNet V2, ResNet 50, VGG16, and VGG19), and four classifiers (MLP, SVM, DT, and KNN) for a binary classification of breast pathological images over the BreakHis and FNAC datasets. The designed architectures were evaluated using: (1) four classification performance criteria (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), (2) Scott Knott (SK) statistical test to cluster the proposed architectures and identify the best cluster of the outperforming architectures, and (3) the Borda Count voting method to rank the best performing architectures. The results showed the potential of combining deep learning techniques for feature extraction and classical classifiers to classify breast cancer in malignant and benign tumors. The hybrid architecture using the MLP classifier and DenseNet 201 for feature extraction (MDEN) was the top performing architecture with higher accuracy values reaching 99% over the FNAC dataset, 92.61%, 92%, 93.93%, and 91.73% over the four magnification factor values of the BreakHis dataset: 40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X, respectively. The results of this study recommend the use of hybrid architectures using DenseNet 201 for the feature extraction of the breast cancer histological images because it gave the best results for both datasets BreakHis and FNAC, especially when combined with the MLP classifier.","['Computer-Aided Diagnosis', ' Breast Cancer', ' Classification', ' Deep Convolutional Neural Networks', ' Image Processing', ' Histological Images', ' Hybrid architecture', 'BORDA COUNT', ' REGIONS']",2022.0,BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES,['Engineering'],[''],False,1,False,52
Influence of surface dissolution on reagents' adsorption on low-grade phosphate ore and its flotation selectivity,"['Aarab, I', ' Derqaoui, M', ' El Amari, K', ' Yaacoubi, A', ' Abidi, A', ' Etahiri, A', ' Bacaoui, A']","A preliminary study was conducted on the Hallimond tube to find routes for the direct flotation of fluorapatite. Carboxymethylcellulose-sodium oleate and sodium alginate-sodium oleate were the most promising depressant-collector combinations. Apatite recovery exceeded 95%. Conversely, replication of these findings in the me-chanical flotation cell proved to be different. The results show a flotation of the calcite, while the fluorapatite remains in the tailings. Grades of 27.63% P2O5 with a recovery of 69.9% and 28.22% P2O5 with a recovery of 73.93% were obtained in the non-floated fraction using 1500 g/t of sodium oleate and 25 g/t of sodium alginate and carboxymethylcellulose as depressants, respectively. The effects of metal ions on the flotation behavior of fluorapatite, calcite, and quartz were investigated through micro-flotation tests and bench-scale flotation experiments. The findings were further elucidated by dissolution study, zeta potential measurements, and FTIR analyses. The results demonstrated that pulp water containing large amounts of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe3+ directly influences the performance of apatite flotation. Fluorapatite recovery substantially dropped from 97.27% in deionized water, reaching values below 11.11% at alkaline pH. These ionic species interfere in the interfacial processes and perturb selective adsorption. Ca2+ ions favor the precipitation of CaCO3, hence forms a coating on the apatite surface, rendering it unavailable for NaOL chemisorption. Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe3+ complex with the reagents and the precipitates adsorb onto the minerals' surfaces, impairing their floatability. Also, their presence activates the quartz surface, increasing its recovery. Zeta potential curves overlap, implying a similar build-up of negative charge on the three mineral surfaces. The most intense peaks in FTIR spectra indicated more adsorption, suggesting that the detrimental species Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe3+ must be involved in adsorption mechanisms and explain flotation trend change.","['Low-grade phosphate ore', ' Metallic ions', ' Surface dissolution', ' Selective adsorption', ' Sodium alginate', ' Sodium oleate', 'CALCIUM MINERALS', ' SODIUM OLEATE', ' OLEIC-ACID', ' APATITE', ' SEPARATION', ' PERFORMANCE', ' MECHANISM', ' COLLECTOR', ' SCHEELITE', ' EFFICIENT']",2021.0,COLLOID SURFACE A,['Chemistry'],"['APPHOS', 'RD', 'VI', 'CNRST', 'MESRSFC']",False,5,True,76

MiSeq Amplicon sequencing targeting bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS was performed to assess microbial community changes following treatments. Our results showed that soybean nodulation and shoot dry weight biomass increased when phytate was applied to the nutrient-poor substrate mixture. Bacterial and fungal diversities of the root and rhizosphere biotopes were relatively resilient following inoculation by microbial suspension; however, bacterial community structure was significantly influenced.

The studied formulations were prepared as hybrid materials based on halloysite and alginate [Ha-Ag] or montmorillonite and alginate polymers [Mt-Ag] and were applied to the bacterial strains to develop low cost, efficient, and slow-release capsules. Their efficiency was evaluated in comparison with alginate [Ag] as the control. The produced capsules were spherical in shape and were chemically and physically characterized and further analyzed for their swelling ratios, soil biodegradability, release kinetics of microbial cells, and their survival stability over 3 months of storage under different conditions (room temperature vs 4 degrees C). The effect of the capsules on the growth of wheat plants was also investigated. Results showed that both formulations were able to preserve bacterial survival which reached 14.8 log CFU g(-1) after 3 months storage in the halloysite formulation. The swelling ratios were ranged between 61.5 +/- 1.35% and 36.5 +/- 5% for the montmorillonite and the halloysite formulations, respectively. The release kinetics revealed the slow-release capacity of the capsules mainly with the halloysite formulation which significantly released bacterial cells after 15 days of incubation in saline water (15.24 log CFU mL(-1)). The application of the capsules to wheat plants significantly increased root and shoot biomasses and nitrogen content in the roots. In conclusion, halloysite minerals seem to be more adapted as additive to alginate in microbial encapsulation.","['PSEUDOMONAS-PUTIDA RS-198', ' CONTROLLED-RELEASE', ' PLANT-GROWTH', ' SALT-STRESS', ' BENTONITE', ' RHIZOBACTERIA', ' COMPOSITES', ' BEHAVIOR']",2021.0,CURR MICROBIOL,['Microbiology'],['MAScIR Foundation'],False,1,False,32

For a period of 43 years (1976-2019), the piezometric level shows a continuous decline which reaches 8 m for the Barremian-Aptian aquifer and 5 m for the Hauterivian. Hydrogeochemical analysis shows (i) a remarkable evolution of the facies from the Cl-Na facies to the Cl-Ca-Mg facies, (ii) the groundwater mineralization is governed by the dissolution and bases exchange phenomenon, (iii) the spatial-temporal evolution of the groundwater quality shows a gradual deterioration in time and space. The isotopic technique shows that the groundwater recharge is ensured by precipitation of oceanic origin without notable evaporation. Tritium tracing shows that the recharge of groundwater is post-nuclear, confirming that the recharge of the aquifers within the study area is in close relation to the precipitation. This recharge takes place at altitudes varying between 500 and 700 m asl for the Barremian-Aptian aquifer and between altitudes 350 and 400 m asl for the Hauterivian aquifer.

The intrinsic, n-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), and p-type a-SiC:H thin films were deposited using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 13.56 MHz plasma excitation frequency and on 20 x 20 cm(2) and SnO2:F covered glass substrates. Low rf-power densities (less than 0.1 W/cm(2)) and substrate temperatures (less than 190 degrees C) were used for this purpose. Raman spectra of the films are dominated by a broad peak around 480 cm(-1) that is the characteristic of the amorphous silicon network for all the three types of films. Scanning electron microscopy measurements revealed that the surface of the a-Si:H films deposited on SnO2:F-coated glass substrates (Asahi-VU) replicates the texture of the SnO2:F film. Spectroscopic ellipsometry spectra were analyzed with the Tauc-Lorentz dispersion model, and the results revealed that the optical gap of the intrinsic a-Si:H films is on the order of 1.7 eV, while that of the a-SiC:H is on the order of 1.8 eV. These results were further confirmed by optical transmission measurements. The highest efficiency obtained for solar cells prepared with shadow masking under our condition is on the order of 8.83% with a V-oc of 0.856 V, a short circuit current density of 15.6 mA/cm(2), and a fill factor of 66.07%. The obtained efficiency is slightly lower than the record efficiency obtained in this family of cells (10.3%) prepared by laser scribing because the low short-circuit current slightly lowers the fill factor.

We compare ourfindings with the changing characteristics of other metropolitan administrative elites, notably the French prefets. The variations we observe can be explained by changes in the relationship between France and its colonies, in the relative attractiveness of a colonial career, and in the process of institutionalisation of the colonies. Between 1830 and 1960, colonial careers offered more opportunities for upward social mobility than administrative careers in the metropole. In particular, the creation of the French colonial administration at the turn of the twentieth century favoured individuals from modest social backgrounds or those who had pursued atypical career paths. The increased professionalization of colonial careers after the First World War led to a greater homogenization of occupational trajectories and social backgrounds of colonial governors. Nevertheless, the possibility of upward social mobility remained significant for colonial administrators, and eroded only with the upheavals of the Second World War.","['France', ' 20th century', ' colonial empire', ' social mobility', ' administrative elite', ' prosopography', 'FRANCE']",2019.0,REV HIST MOD CONTEMP,['History'],[''],False,1,False,74

Four adsorption isotherms are: Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Van Huay were used to describe adsorption processes. Composite surface (0-20 cm) depth soil samples from four districts sites were collected. The results revealed that the K adsorption data coincide with both models with (r(2) = 0.99).

Deploying a previously developed configuration model the purpose of this paper is to test the industrial usability of the model as an instrument to gain a better understanding of the material transformation system through externalising the generic production capabilities of the system. Design/methodology/approach - In a multiple case study approach and using a prior conceptual configuration model of the material transformation system in the process industries as a research instrument, company-generic production capabilities were investigated in three companies representing the mineral, food and steel industries. Findings - The empirical results supported the utility of the model as an instrument in providing a coherent set of elements that define operations and thus serve as a platform to model company-generic production capabilities and serve as input to strategizing though implicating needed change to the material transformation system. The theoretical contribution was mainly the empirical validation of the previously developed conceptual model as a tool in knowledge formation of the capabilities of the system and to outline the concept of production capabilities configuration. Research limitations/implications - Three sectors of the process industries were studied but it is recommended that the results should be replicated in complementary case studies or a survey of larger samples from the process industries. Those studies should not only be limited to increase the empirical knowledge base, but possibly to identify additional new variables, further refine the set of variables in the present model and investigate their relationships. Practical implications - It is argued that the model can already be used as a tool to support both horizontal and vertical communication on production capabilities, thus facilitating, e.g. manufacturing strategy development.

Concerning the piezometric approach, it shows a general descent in piezometric surface for the period of observation (reached 12 m in some wells). The downward evolution of piezometric surface due to the decrease of precipitation has resulted in the spatial and temporal degradation of the groundwater quality.

One way to improve agronomic practices is by using slow-release fertilizers (SRF) that have shown interesting role in optimizing nutrients availability for plants growth. Considering the current ecological concerns, coated SRF using ecofriendly materials continue to attract great attention. In this context, novel waterborne and biodegradable coating nano composite formulations were elaborated from cellulose nanocrystals (CNC)-filled poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for slow release NPK fertilizer with water retention property. CNC were extracted from hemp stalks using sulfuric acid hydrolysis process and their physico-chemical characteristics were investigated. CNC with various weight loadings (6, 10, 14.5 wt%) were incorporated into PVA polymer via solvent mixing method to produce viscous coating nanocomposite formulations with moderated shear viscosity. Uniform PVA@CNC coating microlayer was applied on the surface of NPK fertilizer granules in Wurster chamber of a fluidized bed dryer at controlled spraying and drying parameters. The nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium release profiles from coated NPK fertilizer were determined in water and soil. It was found that the coating materials extended the N-P-K nutrients release time from 3 days for uncoated fertilizer to 10 and 30 days for neat PVA-and CNC/PVA-coated fertilizer in soil medium, indicating the positive role of the presence of CNC in the PVA-based coatings. The morphology, coating rate and crushing strength of the as-prepared coated products were investigated in addition to their effect on water holding capacity and water retention of the soil. Enhanced crushing strength and water retention with a positive effect on the soil moisture were observed after coating NPK fertilizer, mainly with high CNC content (14.5 wt%).

In some countries like Cameroon, it is still not clear how maize, millet and rice will respond to changes in growing season precipitation. This work examines the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of the above crops to droughts at both the national and sub-national scale. Crop yield data were culled from FAOSTAT while growing season precipitation data were culled from the database of UNDP/Oxford University and the climate portal of the World Bank. Adaptive capacity proxies (literacy, and poverty rate) were collected from KNOEMA and the African Development Bank. The analysis was performed using the vulnerability index equation. Nationally, millet has the lowest vulnerability and rice has the highest. At the sub-national scale, northern maize has the highest vulnerability followed by western highland rice. It is observed that when scales change, the crops that are vulnerable also change. However, at both levels vulnerability has an inverse relationship with adaptive capacity.","['patterns', ' sensitivity', ' exposure', ' adaptive capacity', ' vulnerability', ' precipitation maize', ' crop yields', 'SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA', ' CLIMATE-CHANGE', ' VULNERABILITY', ' YIELD', ' VARIABILITY', ' RESILIENCE', ' POVERTY', ' DROUGHT', ' SYSTEM', ' TRENDS']",2021.0,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,['Agriculture'],['VI'],False,1,True,61
Mobilizing the Masses: Measuring Resource Mobilization on Twitter,"['Reda, AA', ' Sinanoglu, S', ' Abdalla, M']","How can we measure the resource mobilization (RM) efforts of social movements on Twitter? In this article, we create the first ever measure of social movements' RM efforts on a social media platform. To this aim, we create a four-conditional lexicon that can parse through tweets and identify those concerned with RM. We also create a simple RM score that can be plotted in a time series format to track the RM efforts of social movements in real time. We use our tools with millions of tweets from the United States streamed between November 28, 2018, and February 11, 2019, to demonstrate how our measure can help us estimate the saliency and persistency of social movements' RM efforts. We find that our measure captures RM by successfully cross checking the variation of this score against protest events in the United States during the same time frame. Finally, we illustrate the descriptive and qualitative utility of our tools for understanding social movements by running conventional topic modeling algorithms on the tweets that were used to compute the RM score and point at specific avenues for theory building and testing.","['social movements', ' natural language processing', ' Twitter', ' resource mobilization theory', ' American politics']",,SOCIOL METHOD RES,"['Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences', ' Sociology']","['SSHRC', 'NSERC', 'VI']",False,3,True,96
Filtered Multicarrier Waveforms Classification: A Deep Learning-Based Approach,"['Zerhouni, K', ' Amhoud, E', ' Chafii, M']","Automatic signal recognition (ASR) plays an important role in various applications such as dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio, hence it will be a key enabler for beyond 5G communications. Recently, many research works have been exploring deep learning (DL) based ASR, where it has been shown that simple convolutional neural networks (CNN) can outperform expert features based techniques. However, such works have been primarily focusing on single-carrier signals. With the advent of spectrally efficient filtered multicarrier waveforms, we propose in this paper, to revisit the DL based ASR to account for the variety and complexity of these new transmission schemes. Specifically, we design two types of classification algorithms. The first one relies on the cyclostationarity characteristics of the investigated waveforms combined with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier; while the second one explores the use of a four-layer CNN which performs both features extraction and classification. The proposed approaches do not require any a priori knowledge of the received signal parameters, and their performance is evaluated in a multipath channel through simulations for a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranging from -8 to 20 dB. The simulation results show that, despite cyclostationary characteristics being highly discriminative, the CNN outperforms the cyclostationary based classification especially for short time received signals, and low SNR levels.","['OFDM', ' Time-frequency analysis', ' Support vector machines', ' Signal to noise ratio', ' Receivers', ' Deep learning', ' Quadrature amplitude modulation', ' Automatic signal recognition', ' multicarrier waveforms', ' classification', ' deep neural networks', ' support vector machines', ' cyclostationarity', 'CYCLOSTATIONARITY', ' DESIGN']",2021.0,IEEE ACCESS,"['Computer Science', ' Engineering', ' Telecommunications']",[''],False,1,False,54

Temporal Change of Soil Carbon on a Long-Term Experimental Site with Variable Crop Rotations and Tillage Systems,"['Laamrani, A', ' Voroney, PR', ' Berg, AA', ' Gillespie, AW', ' March, M', ' Deen, B', ' Martin, RC']","The impacts of tillage practices and crop rotations are fundamental factors influencing changes in the soil carbon, and thus the sustainability of agricultural systems. The objective of this study was to compare soil carbon status and temporal changes in topsoil from different 4 year rotations and tillage treatments (i.e., no-till and conventional tillage). Rotation systems were primarily corn and soy-based and included cereal and alfalfa phases along with red clover cover crops. In 2018, soil samples were collected from a silty-loam topsoil (0-15 cm) from the 36 year long-term experiment site in southern Ontario, Canada. Total carbon (TC) contents of each sample were determined in the laboratory using combustion methods and comparisons were made between treatments using current and archived samples (i.e., 20 year and 9 year change, respectively) for selected crop rotations. Overall, TC concentrations were significantly higher for no-till compared with conventional tillage practices, regardless of the crop rotations employed. With regard to crop rotation, the highest TC concentrations were recorded in corn-corn-oats-barley (CCOB) rotations with red clover cover crop in both cereal phases. TC contents were, in descending order, found in corn-corn-alfalfa-alfalfa (CCAA), corn-corn-soybean-winter wheat (CCSW) with 1 year of seeded red clover, and corn-corn-corn-corn (CCCC). The lowest TC concentrations were observed in the corn-corn-soybean-soybean (CCSS) and corn-corn-oats-barley (CCOB) rotations without use of cover crops, and corn-corn-soybean-winter wheat (CCSW). We found that (i) crop rotation varieties that include two consecutive years of soybean had consistently lower TC concentrations compared with the remaining rotations; (ii) TC for all the investigated plots (no-till and/or tilled) increased over the 9 year and 20 year period; (iii) the no-tilled CCOB rotation with 2 years of cover crop showed the highest increase of TC content over the 20 year change period time; and (iv) interestingly, the no-till continuous corn (CCCC) rotation had higher TC than the soybean-soybean-corn-corn (SSCC) and corn-corn-soybean-winter wheat (CCSW). We concluded that conservation tillage (i.e., no-till) and incorporation of a cover crop into crop rotations had a positive effect in the accumulation of TC topsoil concentrations and could be suitable management practices to promote soil fertility and sustainability in our agricultural soils.","['agricultural soils', ' soil organic carbon (SOC)', ' total carbon (TC)', ' cropping systems', ' tillage systems', ' SOC', ' TC change', ' long-term experimental site', 'ORGANIC-CARBON', ' MICROBIAL BIOMASS', ' RESIDUE REMOVAL', ' LAND-USE', ' CORN', ' SEQUESTRATION', ' MANAGEMENT', ' CLIMATE', ' DYNAMICS', ' NITROGEN']",2020.0,AGRONOMY-BASEL,"['Agriculture', ' Plant Sciences']","['AGGP', ' Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario', ' Canada First Excellence Research Fund: Food from Thought']",False,3,False,53

The use of this water for drinking purpose requires treatment before its use. For irrigation purpose, groundwater of the studied aquifer remains suitable for plants supporting high salinity.

In this research, the anaerobic digestion of vinasse derived from bioethanol manufacturing is studied on a laboratory-scale using a continuous stirred tank reactor pilot plant at mesophilic conditions (37 degrees C). The quantity of produced biogas from the vinasse was carried out under different operating parameters: pH, agitation, electric conductivity and hydraulic retention time (HRT). Results of this study show that inoculum/vinasse ratio of 0.3 presents removal effectiveness of pollution abatement close to 91% for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) which correspond to maximum biogas production up to 77% of methane for an optimal HRT of 21 d. However, inoculum/vinasse ratio of 0.5 leads to lower removal of COD (85%) and TSS (82%) which represent a total biogas production of only 52%.

Then, the physicochemical properties of the raw FA and the FA were determined. Afterwards, FA was used to prepare a masterbatch of 20 wt% FA and 80 wt% PA by twin-screw extrusion. Using this masterbatch, composites with different FA contents (4.5, 9, 14, and 18.5 wt%), with and without styrene-(ethylene-butylene)-styrene grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MA) (S-g-M), were produced by extrusion, which was followed by injection molding. Subsequently, several characterization techniques were performed to investigate the effect of FA loading and the S-g-M coupling agent on the structural, morphological, thermal, and mechanical properties of the developed composites. The results showed that incorporating FA particles in the matrix blend improved the thermal stability and crystallinity, the Young's modulus, the tensile strength, and torsional properties of the composites. In contrast, the addition of S-g-M coupling agent to the polymer composites improved the interfacial adhesion between FA particles and the matrix blend.

Membrane bioreactor for domestic wastewater treatment: energetic assessment,"['Kitanou, S', ' Ayyoub, H', ' El-Ghzizel, S', ' Belhamidi, S', ' Taky, M', ' Elmidaoui, A']","Increasing interest in sustainable wastewater treatment has led to a fundamental change in treatment system operation. A key aspect of improving overall sustainability is the potential for direct waste-water effluent reuse. However, membrane bioreactors (MBR) have been identified as an attractive option for producing high quality and nutrient-rich effluents for municipal and domestic wastewa-ter treatment. Currently, with the evolution of wastewater treatment projects in Morocco, the MBR process can be used as a technology treating different types of wastewater and to produce effluent with suitable quality for reuse. However, the energetic consumption of this process is a great con -cern, which can limit the development and implementation of this technology. In this investigation, the electric energy consumption of an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor process in domestic waste-water treatment is evaluated and compared to some MBR installations based on literature review. Energy requirements of the MBR are linked to operational parameters and reactor performance. The analysis of energy consumption shows that the biological aeration and membrane filtration are more energy consuming than the other components listed as feed and recirculation pumps. Biological aeration needs 53% of the overall energetic consumption and the specific energy consumption for membrane filtration is about 25%. However, aeration is a major energy consumer, often exceed-ing 50% share of total energy consumption. The best results obtained on the MBR system (pres -sure p = 1.15 bar), hydraulic retention time (15 h) showed removal efficiencies up to 90% in terms of organic compounds removal, 100% in terms of suspended solids presence and up to 80% reduc-tion of total nitrogen and total phosphorus.

Performance of three ultrafiltration ceramic membranes in reducing polluting load of landfill leachate,"['Zait, M', ' Benalla, S', ' Bachiri, B', ' Tahaikt, M', ' Dhiba, D', ' Elmida, A', ' Taky, M']","The Oum Azza Landfill, which is located in the suburb of Rabat, receives daily 2,500-2,800 t of solid waste and produces 660 m(3)/d of landfill leachate. The leachate treatment plant of Oum Azza includes a biological pretreatment (aeration tank and anoxic tank followed by a bag filter), and a membrane processes by reverse osmosis (RO). A low RO recovery rate and frequent stops caused by membranes fouling have been observed, this behavior is mainly due to the poor quality of the effluent after pretreatment. To address this problem and improve the physico-chemical quality of the effluent upstream of the RO processes, we consider in this paper the feasibility of ultrafiltration (UF) separation as a pretreatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the performance of three ceramic UF membranes with different pore sizes (0.02, 0.05 and 0.1 mu m). The transmembrane pressure (TMP) and circulation velocity effect on the quantity and the quality of permeate and on the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and suspended solid (SS) are performed. The pretreatment of the leachate by UF shows that the SS and COD retention increase with TMP for all the tested membranes and reach, for a circulation velocity of 0.5 m/s, the maximum values of 85%, 77% and 72% respectively for COD and 70.4%, 62% and 55% for SS. On the other hand, the study shows that circulation velocity has no influence on the physico-chemical quality of the permeate in the range of the applied TMP. However, for an applied TMP, the flow rate increases with the circulation velocity. The results obtained show a clear improvement in effluent quality compared to the conventional pretreatment used in the leachate treatment plant of Oum Azza but pollutants indicators contents are still high and the effluent cannot be directed to the RO unit.

Recently, different studies are focusing on their dissolution behaviours that can be modified to suit some environmental applications, such as controlled-release fertilisers. In this work, magnesium had been suggested to improve the glass durability of 3P(2)O(5)-2K(2)O-(1 - x)CaO-xMgO glasses (0 <= x <= 1). Indeed, its effect on glass structure, thermal properties and most important dissolution behaviours were studied, in order to evaluate their suitability of being used as controlled-release fertilisers. Various compositions in which calcium was partially replaced by magnesium were prepared by melting at 800 degrees C. The samples were characterised by differential scanning calorimetry, density measurements, X-Ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The dissolution behaviours were investigated using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry ICP-OES, pH measurements and SEM. Substitution of calcium by magnesium reduced the glass density, owing to the lower atomic weight of magnesium compared to calcium, and caused an increase in glass transition and crystallisation temperatures. Magnesium substitution significantly improved the chemical durability of the glasses due to more covalent Mg-O bond than the Ca-O bond.

Assessing the phenomenon of clogging of pervious concrete (Pc): Experimental test and model proposition,"['Sandoval, GFB', ' Galobardes, I', ' Campos, A', ' Toralles, BM']","During rainfall, different types of sediments are transported (organic and inorganic) that end up prejudicing the hydraulic efficiency of materials such as pervious concrete (PC). Sediments tend to accumulate on the surface of the material and its internal pore structure causing a decrease in permeability. This phenomenon is known as clogging. This study aims to identify and characterize the phenomenon of clogging of PC considering laboratory and field conditions. In that sense, a PC mix and three types of sediment (sand (S), clay (C), and mixture of both (S thorn C)) were considered. Two types of permeability tests were adapted to induce the clogging and estimate the permeability reduction: the constant head test (laboratory), and the ASTM C1701 (field). Finally, different rates of clogging (low, medium and high) were considered. Considering the type of sediments, the finer they are the higher is the influence on the clogging phenomenon, reaching maximum permeability reductions greater than 95%. Considering the rate of clogging, the results show that low rate entails higher clogging. On the other hand, an analytical model to describe the clogging was proposed. This predicts efficiently the reduction of permeability considering the type and concentration of sediment. This model was proposed with experimental data obtained and validated with results from other investigations. The model aims to be used for engineers to design PC considering their life span and maintenance.","['Pervious concrete', ' Permeability', ' Porosity', ' Clogging', ' Sediments concentration', ' Service life', 'SUSTAINABLE PAVEMENT MATERIAL', ' OF-THE-ART', ' PERMEABILITY MEASUREMENT', ' INFILTRATION', ' SIZE', ' SAND']",2020.0,J BUILD ENG,"['Construction & Building Technology', ' Engineering']",['CAPES'],False,1,False,61
Suicidal Ideation in Elite Schools: A Test of the Interpersonal Theory and the Escape Theory of Suicide,"['Landrault, H', ' Jaafari, N', ' Amine, M', ' Malka, G', ' Selimbegovic, L', ' Chatard, A']","Objective The present study compared the ability of two contemporary theories of suicidal behavior-the interpersonal and escape theories of suicide-to predict suicidal ideation. The interpersonal theory proposes that the interaction of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness predicts suicidal ideation. The escape theory proposes that feelings of failure predict suicidal ideation and that escape motivation mediates this relationship. The present study intended to determine which of the two theories more successfully explains suicidal ideation. Method A sample of 306 students from elite schools in Morocco (193 women, M-age = 21.21 years, predominantly Muslims) completed a questionnaire assessing feelings of failure and escape motivation, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, suicide ideation, and control variables. Results In line with previous research, separate tests revealed support for the two theories. Interestingly, when entered simultaneously in a multiple regression analysis, the two frameworks explained a unique and cumulative part of the variance in suicidal ideation. Moreover, the effects remained significant after controlling for past suicide attempts, depression, hopelessness, and stress. Conclusions The findings suggest that combining the interpersonal and escape theories of suicide could help better explain the emergence of suicidal ideation among college students.","['ENTRAPMENT', ' DEFEAT', ' DEPRESSION', ' VALIDITY']",2020.0,SUICIDE LIFE-THREAT,"['Psychiatry', ' Psychology']",[''],False,1,False,27

Indeed, they constitute a potential risk that can have adverse effects on human health (for instance, dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, osteosarcoma, etc.) and effects on water resources. The aims of this study are to compare and evaluate the performance of three membranes in the removal of fluorides by nanofiltration (NF) on NaF doped groundwater. In the first part of this study, the influence of different operating conditions (initial fluoride concentration and transmembrane pressure) on the reduction of fluoride ions is investigated. Secondly, three separate predictive models are developed for optimization and modeling of the permeate concentration (mg L-1), fluoride rejection (%) and permeate flux (L m(-2) h(-1)) in NF. Response surface methodology based on central composite design is employed to experimental design and a cumulative study of the effects of various operating parameters such as initial fluoride concentration and transmembrane pressure. Analysis of variance for developed quadratic models exhibits high significance and applicability. The initial fluoride concentration is the most significant factor that has a predominant effect on the permeate concentration for both TR60 and NF270 membranes. Indeed, both membranes exceed the standards, 7 mg L-1 for TR60 and 5.5 mg L-1 for NF270. But for NF90 the influence of the initial fluoride concentration is not significant. In addition, the model is analysed graphically for its predictive ability.

In addition, we predicted the soil textural groups (G1: Fine, G2: Medium, and G3: Coarse) using routine chemical characteristics as auxiliary.

The approach proposed, the spatial distribution of land based on suitability, is founded on the multiple-criteria decision-making method of four parameters; soil texture, temperature, land use, and slope. The duration of the length of crop season was simulated using the concept of growing degree days. The projection of land suitability for 2031-2050 indicated an important decrease of 12.11% of highly suitable agricultural land under the RCP4.5 emission scenario and a significant increase of 4.68% of highly unsuitable land, according to the RCP8.5 emission scenario compared to the baseline (1985-2005). The projected growing degree days in 2031-2050 showed a strong shortening in the growing period length compared to the baseline 1985-2006, mainly under the RCP8.5 emission scenario, with a reduction from 8% to 21% depending on crops.

Soil samples were collected from a depth of 0-20 cm from each land use type of the respective districts for physicochemical analyses. The results showed that land use types significantly affected (P <= 0.05) soil properties such as bulk density, available P, exchangeable potassium, exchangeable acidity, exchangeable bases (Na, K, Ca, Mg), exchangeable acidity, and CEC. Besides, soil pH, OC, and TN were influenced significantly (P <= 0.05) both by districts and land use types. The very strongly acidic soils were found predominantly in the crop and grazing lands whereas a neutral acidity level was found in the enset-coffee land use type of four districts.

Understanding the contribution of different nutrients (N, P, K, S and Zn) toward yields of hybrid rice-hybrid maize cropping system in calcareous soil is a need for large number of smallholder farming systems. A four seasons study was conducted with an objective to develop further knowledge on crop productivity and nutrient performance indicators in this newly adapted emerging farming system. Replicated nutrient omission trials were conducted at Bihar, India. At the calcareous soil, omission of the nutrients reduced yields, and N was the most limiting nutrient followed by P and K. Omission of Zn impacted crop yields more than S omission, effect was more prominent in hybrid maize. Nutrient uptake in the cropping system was declined by 58%, 37%, 34%, 31% and 25% for N, P, K, S, and Zn, respectively, when these nutrients were systematically removed from fertilization schedule. Sustainable Yield Index (SYI) for cropping system was highest in the ample balanced fertilizer treatment. Post-harvest soil nutrient availability declined in the nutrient omission plots as compared to the initial soil status. We included additional treatments of ample balanced nutrient application and unfertilized check where hybrid cultivars were replaced by inbred varieties of rice and maize. Cropping system productivity highlighted the synergistic effect of seed and nutrients. The unfertilized checks reduced yield by 9 t/ha and 5 t/ha for the hybrid and inbred cropping systems, respectively.

Assessment of hydrogeochemical behavior of layered waste rock stockpiles: A meso-scale laboratory experiment,"['Poaty, B', ' Plante, B', ' Bussiere, B', ' Benzaazoua, M']","Large quantities of waste rocks are removed during ore extraction particularly in open pit mining and stored at the surface in piles. When these materials contain reactive minerals and are exposed to surface environmental conditions, they can generate contaminated mine drainage. A new approach of construction of waste rock piles using inclined compacted benches was developed in order to control water infiltration and minimize contamination. An experimental waste rock pile was built on the Lake Tio mine site to evaluate the performance of this approach under field conditions. To address all concerns related to the limitation of the field experiment, laboratory infiltration tests were conducted inside a steel and plexiglass box filled with three layers of different materials including a flow control layer (consisting of two compacted sand and crushed anorthosite sub-layers) and a layer of coarser materials (hemo-ilmenite waste rock containing sulphides and the non-reactive anorthosite waste rock). These infiltration tests were carried out testing different rates of precipitation (8 mm/day, 17 mm/ day and 27 mm/day) at different slopes (0, 3, 5 and 7%). The effects of precipitation rate and box slope on the flow and quality of the infiltrated water in the system were studied in detail. Results show that the inclination angle of the box and the applied rainfall rate largely govern the diversion of water down the slope of the infiltration box. The results also show that the distribution of infiltration within the system was dependent on rainfall intensity. Based on the results of infiltration tests, it was found that nickel and sulfate loadings are influenced by the applied rainfall rates and a better diversion of water by the flow control layer improves the drainage water quality. These results suggest that nickel and sulfate loadings are mainly controlled by the capillary barrier effects (CBEs), flow paths and the flow rate. The findings are useful for improving the use of a flow control layer as a waste rock management and reclamation method.","['Contaminated neutral drainage', ' Physical model', ' Novel waste rock management method', ' Lac Tio mine', 'INCLINED COVERS', ' PHYSICAL MODEL', ' MINE', ' FLOW', ' SYSTEM', ' PREDICTION', ' TRANSPORT', ' DIVERSION', ' DESIGN']",2022.0,APPL GEOCHEM,['Geochemistry & Geophysics'],['NSERC'],False,1,False,54
Environmental desulfurization of mine wastes using various mineral processing techniques: Recent advances and opportunities,"['Ait-Khouia, Y', ' Benzaazoua, M', ' Demers, I']","Management of mine wastes (e.g., waste rock and tailings) is becoming an increasing global environmental concern for mining industries around the world. With environmental regulations becoming more restrictive, there is a continuously growing need to develop efficient and clean integrated techniques to sustainably manage mine wastes. Mines wastes often contain acid-forming minerals, such as sulfides and sulfosalts that are responsible for generating contamination. Environmental desulfurization using non-selective flotation has recently been implemented as an integrated management approach for mine tailings. Furthermore, physical separation techniques, commonly used in mineral processing and offering a remarkable potential for sulfur and valuable minerals enrichment, are rarely used to manage mine wastes. The separation methods for sulfides and sulfosalts, which are based on the physical properties of the minerals, can achieve the same performance as flotation. These physical properties are mainly related to: i) the particle size distribution, ii) the difference in density between the targeted minerals (i.e., sulfides and sulfosalts) and those of the gangue minerals, iii) the magnetic properties, iv) the electrical attributes, and v) the response to specific sensing. Based on the discrepancy between mineral properties, various methods are proposed, including sieving/screening, hydrodynamic classification, gravity concentration, dense medium separation, magnetic and electrical separation, and sensor-based sorting. These techniques could be considered to be more efficient, less expensive, and more respectful of the environment than flotation. This critical review aims to evaluate the suitability of these physical separation techniques, other than the widely used flotation, to mine waste environmental desulfurization. The paper includes a brief description of these techniques, a discussion of their advantages, and their limitations for the removal of the most common sulfides and sulfosalts (mainly responsible for contaminated mine drainage). Indeed, the application of one or more of these mineral processing techniques requires specific conditions, which depend on the size-by-size mineralogical characterization of each mine waste. The specific requirements for the application of each technique are explored.","['Mine wastes', ' Sulfides', ' Sulfosalts', ' Contaminated mine drainage', ' Environmental desulfurization', ' Flotation', 'FINE COAL', ' PYRRHOTITE TAILINGS', ' METAL REMOVAL', ' ROCK', ' SEPARATION', ' PREDICTION', ' MANAGEMENT', ' EFFICIENCY', ' JOUTEL', ' PERFORMANCE']",2021.0,MINER ENG,"['Engineering', ' Mineralogy', ' Mining & Mineral Processing']",[''],False,1,False,116
Nanofiltration-reverse osmosis hybrid process for hardness removal in brackish water with higher recovery rate and minimization of brine discharges,"['Elazhar, F', ' Elazhar, M', ' El-Ghzizel, S', ' Tahaikt, M', ' Zait, M', ' Dhiba, D', ' Elmidaoui, A', ' Taky, M']","In this paper, the feasibility of hybrid nanofiltration-reverse osmosis (NF-RO) process to remove hardness in brackish water at higher recovery rate and concentrate minimization is investigated. Two nanofiltration (NF) membranes are tested in the first stage for selecting the appropriate membrane on the basis of lower applied pressure and higher permeate flow. Then the evaluation of the performances of hybrid NF-RO system of each stage is studied in terms of recovery rate and Langelier saturation index (LSI) values to prevent the corrosion potential. The blending strategy is adopted with NF brine and reverse osmosis (RO) permeate in order to bring the RO permeate characteristics in accordance with drinking water standards and to minimize the volume of NF brine. Also, energy consumption performance of conventional nanofiltration (NF-NF) and NF-RO hybrid system in hardness removal is compared. The results show that the NF-RO hybrid system combined to blending strategy provides the simplest process but most energy efficient process compared to a single conventional NF-NF. Moreover, including NF upstream of RO is responsible of the increasing of the overall water recovery rate (95 %) and of the permeate quality with lower total dissolved solids (TDS). However, less water with lower salinity treated by RO increases significantly the recovery rate in RO stage up to 80 %. The portion rate of NF brine blending with RO permeate is equal to 32.45 %, corresponding to 240 L/h, which meet the water quality regulations for drinking water. Hybrid NF-RO system has a lower energy cost per m 3 than NF-NF, it is around of 0.055 $/m(3). At the same time, this procedure minimizes the fraction of brine disposal dumping to sewage, making it environmentally friendly. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Dominance criteria on grids for measuring competitive balance in sports leagues,"['Dubois, M']","The paper proposes a dominance criterion that assesses whether a seasonal outcome of a sports league is more balanced than another. This criterion is based on a novel third-order stochastic dominance defined on finite sets of evenly spaced seasonal points (seasonal grids), called downward seasonal balance (DSB). The DSB criterion makes the same assessments as the well-known Lorenz criterion. However, the converse is not true: The DSB criterion makes assessments even in cases where the Lorenz criterion cannot. The former is then less incomplete than the latter. The assessments of the DSB criterion reflect the unanimity of a class of competitive balance indices. A seasonal outcome is more balanced than another according to the DSB criterion if and only if every index of the class agrees. Such a class is axiomatically characterized so that the indices place at least as much emphasis on the balance between leading competitors as on the balance occurring among the nonleading competitors.

Salinity is one of the most devastating abiotic stresses that alter the growth and development of plants and affect the crop yield, especially in arid and semi-arid area such as Tunisia. To surmount the damaging effect of salinity, it is important to develop tolerant cultivars of faba bean. In this study, we examined the behavior of four faba bean cultivars in response to salinity stress. Plants were grown in hydroponics at 0, 75 and 150 mM of NaCl, and 16 morphological, photosynthetic and physiological parameters were assessed. Our data showed a significant genotypic variation for salt tolerance in faba bean among the studied cultivars. All measured parameters were affected by salinity at moderate salt concentration (75 mM), while there was a more pronounced reduction of all parameters at severe salt concentration (150 mM).

Deep Learning-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion Approach for Producing High-Resolution NDVI Time-Series Datasets,"['Htitiou, A', ' Boudhar, A', ' Benabdelouahab, T']","The availability of concurrently high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing data is highly desirable as they represent a key element for effective monitoring in various environmental applications. However, due to the tradeoff between the spatial resolution and acquisition frequency of current satellites, such data are still lacking. Many studies have been undertaken trying to overcome these problems; however, a couple of long-standing limitations remain, including accommodating abrupt temporal changes, dealing with complex and heterogeneous landscapes, and integrating other satellite datasets as well. Accordingly, this paper proposes a deep learning spatiotemporal data fusion approach based on Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) to fuse the NDVI retrievals from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images. The performances of VDSR are analyzed in comparison with those of two other classical methods, the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) method. The results obtained indicate that VDSR outperforms other data fusion algorithms as it generated the least blurred images and the most accurate predictions of synthetic NDVI values, particularly in areas with heterogeneous landscapes and abrupt land-cover changes. The proposed algorithm has broad prospects to improve near-real-time agricultural monitoring purposes and derivation of crop status conditions in the field-scale.","['INDEX-THEN-BLEND', ' SPATIAL-RESOLUTION', ' LANDSAT']",2021.0,CAN J REMOTE SENS,['Remote Sensing'],[''],False,1,False,72

A surrogate model for efficient quantification of uncertainties in multilayer shallow water flows,"['Al-Ghosoun, A', ' El Mocayd, N', ' Seaid, M']","In this study, we investigate the implementation of a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) POD-PCE surrogate model for the propagation and quantification of the uncertainty in hydraulic modelling.

Multi-Decadal Variability and Future Changes in Precipitation over Southern Africa,"['Sian, KTCLK', ' Wang, JH', ' Ayugi, BO', ' Nooni, IK', ' Ongoma, V']","The future planning and management of water resources ought to be based on climate change projections at relevant temporal and spatial scales. This work uses the new regional demarcation for Southern Africa (SA) to investigate the spatio-temporal precipitation variability and trends of centennial-scale observation and modeled data, based on datasets from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The study employs several statistical methods to rank the models according to their precipitation simulation ability. The Theil-Sen slope estimator is used to assess precipitation trends, with a Student's t-test for the significance test. The comparison of observation and model historical data enables identification of the best-performing global climate models (GCMs), which are then employed in the projection analysis under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. The GCMs adequately capture the annual precipitation variation but with a general overestimation, especially over high-elevation areas. Most of the models fail to capture precipitation over the Lesotho-Eswatini area. The three best-performing GCMs over SA are FGOALS-g3, MPI-ESM1-2-HR and NorESM2-LM. The sub-regions demonstrate that precipitation trends cannot be generalized and that localized studies can provide more accurate findings. Overall, precipitation in the wet and dry seasons shows an initial increase during the near future over western and eastern SA, followed by a reduction in precipitation during the mid- and far future under both projection scenarios.

For any such rule and any number of alternatives, we introduce a new approach allowing us to characterize all the outcomes that are manipulable by a coalition of voters.

"Effect of service quality on visitor satisfaction, destination image and destination loyalty - practical, theoretical and policy implications to avitourism","['Kumar, MD', ' Govindarajo, NS', ' Khen, MHS']","Purpose Tourism researchers proposed that service quality dimensions of tourist destinations can contribute in developing a favorable or unfavorable image among travelers which affect visitors' loyalty or disloyalty as well as destination image. However, such claims are seldom evaluated into in avitourism locations, which are a niche tourism, but fast growing. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between service quality, visitor satisfaction and destination image and destination loyalty among avian tourists. Design/methodology/approach Following a positivist research philosophy with a quantitative, cross-sectional descriptive study design, the study addressed five direct and two indirect relationships in the model. The research followed expectation dis-confirmation theory of Gartner to test the theoretical model. Following purposive sampling, a sample of 384 international avitourists was collected from five avitourism locations of Malaysia. The study applied SmartPLS SEM to analyze the data. Findings The results show that the service quality provided by the park management has a positive impact on visitor satisfaction, destination image and destination loyalty. The study also shows partial mediation effect of visitor satisfaction on destination image and destination loyalty among avitourists. The study extends practical, policy and theoretical implications to the stakeholders of avitourism. Social implications Biodiversity is important in supporting vital ecosystem services (ES) for human as well as animals. The study has its social implications in generating a greater number of employment opportunity for people surrounding the area of avian destinations preserving the biodiverse area. The people in the surroundings area of avitourism locations will get better employment opportunity as guides and nature trail experts, if the avian tourism develops in its real principle. Originality/value Avitourism is a niche tourism. The expectations of the visitors of avitourism locations are entirely varied in comparison with general tourism. Very less studies focused into expectations of the visitors linking human factor of service quality, emotional intelligence, visitor satisfaction, etc. like dimensions that will contribute into dynamic destination image and destination loyalty among avitourists.

Industrial-scale anaerobic digestion of vinasse in Morocco: performances and statistical models,"['Elazhar, M', ' Bouchabchoub, A', ' Elazhar, F', ' Elmidaoui, A', ' Taky, M']","The vinasse causes a serious environmental problem when it is not previously treated before being discharged directly into the environment. Organic loading rate (OLR) is an important operating variable for the anaerobic digestion (AD) process related to system stability, waste treatment capacity and biogas production. For this reason, the main aim of this paper is to evaluate the performances in the mesophilic methanogenic AD of a sustainable alternative for the treatment of vinasse over nearly 1 y on an industrial-scale (Sotrameg Company, Souk EL HAD, Municipality Benmansour, Province of Kenitra, Morocco). The evolution of OLR on the stability of the AD of vinasse is evaluated through an experimental study and statistical methods using (ANOVA, Modified Gompertz, Richards, and Logistic). The energy potential of biogas generated from the anaerobic process is also evaluated. Experimental results show that the increase in OLR favors the production of biogas. Thus, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency is 85% at an OLR of 4.2 kg COD m(3)/d and hydraulic retention time of 12 d achieving a methane yield of 70%. The daily energy generation achieved is 6.95 kWh/m3 and approximately 50% of this energy is reused to satisfy the needs of Sotrameg facilities. The proposed statistical models are used to describe the dynamic behavior of methane production and its dependence on OLR. A good fit between the variables estimated by the statistical model and experimental data is obtained, reaching determination coefficients (R-2) greater than 0.9.","['Vinasse', ' Anaerobic digestion', ' Methane yield', ' energy', ' Organic loading rate', ' Kinetic', ' statistical models', 'WASTE']",2021.0,DESALIN WATER TREAT,"['Engineering', ' Water Resources']",[''],False,1,False,27
Geochemical behaviour of benign desulphurised waste rocks for mine drainage control and sustainable management,"['Amar, H', ' Elghali, A', ' Benzaazoua, M']","Large volumes of waste rock (WR) are generated in open-pit mines. WR is characterised by high anisotropy in its physical, chemical, mineralogical, and hydrogeological properties. WR is often deposited in unsaturated piles on the mine surface. Mineralogical investigations defined the diameter of physical locking of sulphides (DPLS) allowing the WR to be separated into two fractions: i) a reactive fine fraction ( 2.4 mm), and ii) an inert coarse fraction ( 2.4 mm). Environmental desulphurisation carried out on the reactive fine fraction decreased the risk of contamination caused by WR oxidation. The geochemical behaviour of three benign desulphurised lithologies (altered greywacke (AGR), carbonated greywacke (CGR) and carbonated porphyry (CPO)) and their corresponding fine fractions (<2.4 mm) were assessed using kinetic weathering cells (WCs). These tests confirmed the effectiveness of environmental desulphurisation to prevent acid mine drainage formation. In fact, geochemical analyses of the leachates from WCs showed that pH values ranged between 7.4 and 8.9. Moreover, instantaneous concentrations of iron and zinc were below 0.5 mg/L and 3 mg/L, respectively. Pyrite oxidation rates, which represent sample reactivity, were higher for head samples (3.01, 4.86, and 2.54 ?mol/kg/day for AGR, CGR, and CPO lithologies, respectively) in comparison to the benign desulphurised materials (2.32, 2.4, and 2.25 ?mol/kg/ day for AGR, CGR, and CPO lithologies, respectively). Pyrite in the dismantled material was only partially liberated or almost encapsulated, making it mineralogically unavailable for oxidation. The benign desulphurised material with low initial sulphide content was potentially non-acid generating at the long-term scale. Upstream environmental desulphurisation has been confirmed as an effective strategy for WR management and valorisation.","['Waste rock', ' Acid mine drainage', ' Weathering cells', ' Oxidation rate', ' Geochemical behaviour', ' Environmental desulphurisation']",2021.0,J GEOCHEM EXPLOR,['Geochemistry & Geophysics'],['NSERC'],False,1,False,81

Novel mixed integer optimization sparse regression approach in chemometrics,"['Bertsimas, D', ' Kitane, DL', ' Azami, N', ' Doucet, FR']","Sparse mathematical modelling plays an increasingly important role in chemometrics due to its interpretability and prediction power. While many sparse techniques used in chemometrics rely on L-1 penalization to create sparser models, Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO) achieves sparsity by imposing constraints directly in the model. In this paper, we develop an intuitive and flexible robust sparse regression framework using MIO. We use constraints and penalization to achieve sparsity and robustness respectively. We test and compare results with those obtained using other techniques generating sparser models such as LASSO and sparse PLS. We also use PLS as a baseline to compare predictive performance. We use a LIBS data set of certified reference materials (CRM) of various mineral ores to illustrate the framework using different objective functions. The MIO framework proposed improves accuracy, sparsity and robustness vs. LASSO and SPLS. MIO achieves an average R-2 higher than other methods on average by at least 10.6%. Robust MIO approach also improves interpretability. It also uses 4.3 variables on average while LASSO and SPLS use 16.1 and 805.8 respectively. We also illustrate how interpretability can help build better models through examples derived from the data sets used. When adding noise to the signal, MIO achieves an R-2 of 0.69 on average when all models have negative R-2 values. The MIO framework proposed is versatile and could be used in other chemometrics applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the objective of this study is to evaluate soil physical properties of long-used cultivated lands. Twelve Land Mapping Units (LMUs) were identified by overlaying slope and soil maps. Twelve composite and 12 undisturbed soil samples were collected from the 12 LMUs, and soil physical properties analyzed. Soil bulk density varied from 1.22 g cm(-3) in LMU3 to 1.68 g cm(-3) in LMU4. Available water capacity ranged from 0.09 in LMU4 to 0.17 in LMU3.

Dynamic lot-sizing with short-term financing and external deposits for a capital-constrained manufacturer,"['Kajjoune, O', ' Aouam, T', ' Zouadi, T', ' Dairi, M']","The interface between operations and finance has recently been of interest to both practitioners and academics, who recognize that coordinating decisions from both functions provides a great opportunity to improve the performance of firms. However, the link between dynamic lot-sizing and financing decisions remains largely unexplored in the literature. This paper investigates a dynamic lot-sizing problem with short-term financing and external deposits for a capital-constrained manufacturer. In each period, the manufacturer finances its operations using a combination of internal cash, short-term loans, and short-term capital subscriptions from shareholders. Furthermore, the manufacturer decides on an amount to send to an external depository to take into consideration the opportunity cost of carrying cash. Two formulations for this integrated problem are presented, structural properties of the optimal solution are derived, and a dynamic programming algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Subsequently, the integrated problem, analysis, and solution procedure are extended to consider the case of a per-period loan limit. A numerical study is conducted to derive insights on the effect of financial and operational parameters, which are then validated using extensive computational experiments. Our results show that integration leads to significant savings, smoother production, and smaller capital subscriptions and external deposits. In addition, while the discount factor affects the number of setups, inventory levels, capital subscriptions, and external deposits, the short-term interest rate determines the choice between using internal cash or short-term loans from the lender.","['Dynamic lot-sizing', ' Short-term financing', ' External deposits', ' Dynamic programming', 'TRADE CREDIT', ' INVENTORY MODEL', ' PERMISSIBLE DELAY', ' SIZE MODEL', ' COST', ' MANAGEMENT', ' DECISIONS', ' POLICY', ' PROFIT']",2021.0,INT J PROD ECON,"['Engineering', ' Operations Research & Management Science']",[''],False,1,False,51

Within these conditions, different water-saving strategies using deficit irrigation (DI) were tested on two six-years old clementine varieties ('Sidi Aissa' and 'Orogrande'). These DI strategies were applied during the second part of fruit growth and during fruit maturation and included: the control treatment (Cntl), in which the trees received 100% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for the entire irrigation season; regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), with an application of 75% of ETc (RDI-1); partial rootzone drying (PRD), with an alternating irrigation between the two root system halves for 3-4 (PRD-3/4) and 7 (PRD-7) days, with an application of 50% crop water requirements; and RDI-2, with an application of 50% of crop water needs during fruit maturation. The results indicate that the trees preferably absorb the water from the upper 0-30 cm-depth soil profile and that fruit drop was increased by PRD for 'Sidi Aissa', whereas RDI-1 had no effect on this parameter. The DI strategies had no effect on fruit drop for 'Orogrande'. The PRD reduced fruit size, yield and fruit juice content, with the effect being more pronounced on 'Sidi Aissa'. The RDI-1 had no effect on fruit yield for 'Orogrande' but reduced it for 'Sidi Aissa'. RDI-2 had no effect on yield, fruit size or fruit juice content. The DIs tested increased water use efficiency and enhanced fruit maturation as a result of increased juice sugar content and reduced acidity.

These sound speed expressions are compared with experimental values. The consequences for CFD models are discussed in the final section of this paper. We outline the fact that any physical model, (on which numerical models could be based through numerical methods) should propagate the pressure-waves in a physically meaningful manner coherent with experimentation.

The impregnation of the PEI molecules onto SiO2 surface was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The changes in porous structures were evaluated by N-2 adsorption at 77 K. The adsorption capacities of SiO2 and PEI/SiO2 were investigated for two contaminants: methylene blue (MB) and lead (Pb(II)). The influence of various parameters (pH, temperature, initial concentration, adsorbent dosage) was studied. Adsorption isotherms were fitted with the Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Brouers-Sotolongo models and the kinetic data with the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models. The results show that raw geothermal SiO2 has an interesting adsorption capacity towards methylene blue (q(e) = 108 mg g(-1)), with no significant enhancement of the adsorption capacity with the PEI impregnated silica. On the other hand, the PEI impregnation significantly improved the adsorption capacity of geothermal silica for lead since q(e) increases from 5.3 to 18 mg g(-1).

China's BRI developmental agency in its own words: A content analysis of key policy documents,"['Alves, AC', ' Lee, SH']","Since its announcement in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has inspired an ever-growing stream of literature cutting across several disciplines, with highest concentration of studies in the social sciences. Unsurprisingly a great deal of these studies are concerned with the rationale behind this massive undertaking and its potential impact in the current world order. Here a clear rift is apparent between those who think of it as a tool serving China's geopolitical interests and rise at the world stage, and those who see it as a more nebulous and fragmented undertaking driven by domestic economic and political pressures. A similar concern is reflected in a smaller body of literature that looks at the BRI from a development angle, the dominant inquiry line revolving around its likely impact in global development governance and the underlying neoliberal cooperation norms and practices. Here too there is a clear divide between those who see China's increasing development agency as a positive complement and those who perceive it in a direct collision course with the neoliberal aid paradigm. This dichotomy of interpretations project two contrasting images of China's development agency that are often difficult to reconcile. This study contributes to this body of literature by providing a profile of China's development agency according to its own words. Since 2015 a raft of BRI policy documents have been published by Beijing to fill the initial void and regain control over the narrative. Through a content analysis of key policy papers and speeches, we attempt to uncover what are the initiative's aims, governance mechanisms, normative under pinnings, and targeted areas as per the official discourse. In doing so we hope to bring more clarity as to the nature of China developmental agency. Based on our findings we argue that much like its domestic development model, China's development cooperation approach is pragmatically hybrid with the rhetoric showing clear signs of convergence but also divergence with the dominant paradigm. The evolving discourse suggests a highly fluid approach and thus a work in constant progress, which progression hinges upon reactive and cumulative adjustments to feedback as the initiative is rolled out.

The final composts showed a high reduction that reached 99% for faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci; and 100% for Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. These reductions revealed the efficiency of composting on bacteria inactivation. Comparison between the survivals of the two bacteriophages showed that Salmonella-phages have less tolerance to inactivation than coliphages, it was totally eliminated after 45 days of composting, while coliphages were completely inactivated after 200 days. The complete destruction of the bacteriophages showed the safety and the good microbial quality of the three co-composting trials. These findings revealed that in the case of composting on windrows, a maximum temperature about 50 degrees C and time which, exceeds 5 months are essential to decrease pathogenic bacteria and virus to a safe level. We conclude that co-composting conditions of mixtures containing half and onethird of the sludge were more adequate for a rapid destruction of pathogens, compared to mixture containing two-third of the sludge. Based on this study, we anticipate that the proposed analysis will yield a rapid indicator of co-composting hygienization design with less dependency simple and fast technique. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Numerical investigation and experimental validation of the thermal performance enhancement of a compact finned-tube heat exchanger for efficient latent heat thermal energy storage,"['Amagour, ME', ' Bennajah, M', ' Rachek, A']","This paper presents a numerical study of heat transfer performance inside a compact finned-tube heat exchanger employed in latent heat storage (LHS). A three-dimensional mathematical model of the storage system was developed and validated based on experimental results of charging and discharging. The heat transfer problem during phase change was addressed by solving Navier-Stokes equations combined with enthalpy-porosity technique. Visualization of thermal process inside the storage unit, which cannot be fully realized using an experimental set-up, was carried out by exploiting simulation results. Due to the heat transfer fluid (HTF) circuit design, it was found that phase change occurs faster in the lower half of storage tank and especially in phase change material (PCM) neighboring HTF inlet. Stripes of PCM adjacent to tank walls where heat transport is slow were identified. The model was used to conduct parametric studies of the effects of the HTF inlet temperature, the flow rate, the number and the position of fins on charging and discharging performances. Concerning operation parameters, increasing HTF flow rate from 0.4 to 0.62 l/min reduces charging time by 31% and discharging time by 29%. Similarly, increasing temperature difference between HTF and PCM by 10 degrees C accelerates melting process by 30% and solidification process by 21%. Since charging is slower than discharging in the studied system, the influence of design parameters on charging was investigated. As a consequence, it was proven that increasing the number of fins reduces melting time and raises storage power. However, adding more than 13 complete fins to the studied device was shown to cause limited improvement. Moreover, positioning fins in the upper half of the heat exchanger has the best benefit on melting time. In addition, increasing fins thickness and changing their material from aluminum to copper was proven to reduce total melting time. Therefore, an improved design was proposed based on the previous conclusions and melting time was reduced by 9% compared to the initial configuration. Comparison of the improved compact finned-tube storage device with other LHS units found in literature showed that the non-dimensional storage time obtained with the novel configuration compares well with other well-established LHS configurations. The results of the present work provide operation and design assistance for LHS systems consisting of compact finned-tube heat exchangers intended to store heat such as solar thermal energy.

"Prokaryotic-Type Aspartate Aminotransferase in Sorghum Leaves: Localization, Distribution and Potential Role","['El Omari, R', ' Ben Mrid, R', ' Bouargalne, Y', ' Nhiri, M']","The first part of this work consists in the identification of a prokaryotic-type bifunctional enzyme (aspartate aminotransferase, PT-AAT) in photosynthetic cells of Sorghum-sudangrass hybrid seedsSorghumxdrummondii(Nees ex Steud.) Millsp. and Chase. The results obtained show that the enzyme is constituted by a subunit of 45 kDa immunologically similar to the enzymes of C(3)plants and gymnosperms. This result suggests a high degree of conservation of the PT-AAT in higher plants. To investigate whether the expression of AAT is associated with the differentiation of leaves, we analyzed the chlorophyll levels and AAT, glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), Rubisco and nitrate reductase (NR) contents in serial sections of the leaves. The chlorophyll content was high in the top sections; and then decreased toward basal sections in a continuous gradient. The Rubisco and NR contents matched the pattern of chlorophyll in the leaves with high levels in the aged section and very low levels in the basal sections. In contrast to chlorophyll, Rubisco and NR contents, GS(2)and Fd-GOGAT polypeptides markedly increased from the top to the basal sections of leaves. However the patterns of AAT and IDH polypeptides did not change in different sections. In the second part of this work, to determine the relative localization of AAT, mesophyll cells (MCs) and bundle-sheath cells (BSCs) of sorghum leaves were separated by cellulase and macerase digestion.

Before its consumption, this grain goes through many processes that can alter its nutritional value. Here we report the effect of processing (polishing and milling) and cooking (boiling and steaming) on the saponin content, mineral profile of 14 elements using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES), protein content, and total phenolic compound. The polishing caused an average drop in the saponin content from 1.7% to 0.46% but induced important losses in mineral content (K, Mg, Ca, Zn, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Ni), and phenolic compounds. However, the greatest nutritional degradation happened after milling due to the elimination of seed teguments and embryos, where over 50% of many minerals, 60% of protein content, and almost the totality of phenolic compounds, were lost. Cooking effect was less important than processing, but some significant losses were attested. Boiling caused a loss of up to 40% for some minerals like K, B, and Mo because of their hydrosolubility, and 88% of the polyphenols, while steaming allowed a better retention of those nutrients. Consuming polished quinoa instead of semolina and using steaming instead of boiling are trade-offs consumer needs to make to get optimal benefits from quinoa virtues.","['Chenopodium quinoa', ' processing', ' cooking', ' minerals', ' saponins', ' TPC', 'PROTEIN', ' QUALITY', ' PROFILE', ' WILLD.', ' DIETS', ' FOOD']",2020.0,FOODS,['Food Science & Technology'],['OCP'],True,1,False,40

Three field trials were conducted with inoculated and non-inoculated plots. Four to ten roots and their rhizosphere soil samples of two growth stages for corn and wheat, and one growing stage of soybean, were collected, totalling 122 root and soil samples. Root colonization was measured microscopically, and the fungal communities were determined by paired-end Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing using 18S rDNA marker. After quality trimming and merging of paired ends, 6.7 million sequences could be assigned to 414 different operational taxonomic units. These could be assigned to 68 virtual taxa (VT) using the AMF reference sequence database MaarjAM. The most abundant VT corresponded to R. irregularis. The inoculation treatment did not influence the presence of R. irregularis, or AMF community diversity in roots.

This part of the study is done by Spiegler-Kedem-Katchalsky (SKK) model that relates permeate flux to the rejection of the four anions by using a polyamide NF90 and BW30 membranes and leads to distinguish diffusion and convection phenomena. Secondly, the transport parameters determined using the SKK model (reflection coefficients and solute permeability P-s) are used in the steric hindrance pore (SHP) model to calculate the structural characteristics of the NF90 membrane. The results show that the permeabilities of ions in nanofiltration (NF) membrane are greater than that of reverse osmosis (RO) and, reflection coefficients (sigma) are almost similar for both membranes. For the transfer process, the mechanism is convective and diffusional for the NF membrane, whereas for the RO membrane it is diffusional. The estimated average of r(p) and A(k)/Delta x for NF membrane are r(p) = 0.16 nm and Delta x/A(k) = 25.50 x 10(-7) m. Thirdly, this study is completed by a fouling investigation which is based on two experiments carried out separately. The first one is performed by studying the permeate flux decline vs. time. Based on the insight gained from these experiments, Hermia model is applied to determine exactly the type of fouling phenomenon. The second experiment for fouling investigation is based on the determination of different pure water permeability. The experimental data is applied to the resistance in series model to calculate the total resistance (R-t) related to both membranes, NF90 and BW30. The results of both fouling models obtained complemented each other and reveal the problems caused by the accumulation of deposits on the membrane surface.

In nature, some seeds (for example, chia and basil) produce a mucilage-based hydrogel that creates a germination-promoting microenvironment by retaining water, regulating nutrient entry and facilitating interactions with beneficial microorganisms. Inspired by this strategy, a two-layered biopolymer-based seed coating has been developed to increase germination and water-stress tolerance in semi-arid, sandy soils.

Variables associated with yields were evaluated using linear regression and regression classification. Biomass production ranged between 1.0 and 16.6 for maize, and between 0.2 and 11.9 t ha(-1) for pigeonpea (at maize harvest). The corresponding grain yields ranged between 0.1 and 9.5 for maize, and between 0.1 and 2.1 t ha(-1) for pigeonpea.

This is a Paper about Demonstratives,"[""O'Madagain, C""]","Demonstratives (words like 'this' and 'that') and indexicals (words like 'I', 'here', and 'now') seem intuitively to form a semantic family. Together they form the basic set of directly referring 'context sensitive' terms whose reference changes as the environment or identity of the speaker changes. Something that we might expect of a semantics for indexicals is therefore that it would be closely related to a semantics of demonstratives, although recent approaches have generally treated them separately. A promising new theory of indexicals is the 'token-contextual' account, which accounts for a wide range of uses of indexicals without encountering the problems faced by competing models. So far this theory has not been considered for demonstratives, however, but only for the indexicals 'I', 'here' and 'now'. In this paper I show that the token-contextual account can be elegantly extended to cover demonstratives. Doing so restores unity to our understanding of a natural semantic family, and allows us to identify a single rule governing the most basic context-sensitive terms.","['Demonstratives', ' Indexicals', ' Contextualism', ' Tokens', ' Kaplan', 'INDEXICALS', ' INTENTIONS', ' TOKENS', ' TRUTH']",2021.0,PHILOSOPHIA,['Philosophy'],[''],False,1,False,53

Comparing the Influence of Residual Stress on Composite Materials Made of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and Amorphous Hydrogenated Carbon (a-C:H) Layers: Differences Caused by Single Side and Full Substrate Film Attachment during Plasma Coating,"['Schlebrowski, T', ' Ouali, R', ' Hahn, B', ' Wehner, S', ' Fischer, CB']","Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bio-based, biodegradable and commercially used polymer, which in its native form is unfortunately not generally applicable. A widely used technique to adapt polymers to a wider range of applications is the surface modification with amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H) layers, realized by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD). However, this process creates intrinsic stress in the layer-polymer system which can even lead to full layer failure. The aim of this study was to investigate how the carbon layer is affected when the basic polymer film to be coated can follow the stress and bend (single side attachment) and when it cannot do so because it is firmly clamped (full attachment). For both attachment methods, the a-C:H layers were simultaneously deposited on PHB samples. Ex-situ characterization was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for surface morphology and contact angle (CA) measurements for wettability. In addition, the stress prevailing in the layer was calculated using the Stoney equation.

Spatial assessment of losses in wheat production value: A need for an innovative approach to guide risk management policies,"['Lionboui, H', ' Benabdelouahab, T', ' Htitiou, A', ' Lebrini, Y', ' Boudhar, A', ' Hadria, R', ' Elame, F']","Despite the importance of wheat production, it does not fully meet the population's needs and the wheat producers denounce reduced margins. Considering its impact on the socio-economic conditions in rural areas, risk of losses in wheat production value has been analyzed at the level of 34 provinces, representing 70% of the total wheat cropping area in Morocco. To achieve this analysis, we adopted in this study an innovative approach that takes into account of both phenological stages of wheat crops in time and space, as well as the technological difference between different production units. First, the intensity of the risk of loss in wheat production value was estimated at the spatial scale using a new Production Value Intensity Index (PV_I), proposed in this research. Then, the probability of the identified risk was measured during the studied years (2001-2016). Taking into account variations in both spatial and temporal scales, the results identify four categories of agricultural areas according to their risk level of loss in wheat production value. The last one, accounting for 20.13% of total agricultural area, was the most affected by the loss in wheat production value. Overall, the followed approach, using PV_I index, allows an efficient identification, localization and evaluation of the risks associated to wheat productivity loss at the spatiotemporal scales and will helps decision-makers to implement a risk monitoring strategy.","['Risk assessment', ' Wheat productivity', ' Yields estimation', ' Production value', 'AGRICULTURE', ' SENSITIVITY', ' SYSTEMS']",2020.0,REMOTE SENS APPL,"['Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Remote Sensing']",[''],False,1,False,43

Pairing Experimental and Mathematical Modeling Studies on Fluidized Beds for Enhancement of Models Predictive Quality: A Current Status Overview,"['Uribe, S', ' Al-Dahhan, M']","Modeling of gas-solid fluidized systems has been a prevailing challenge over the last few decades. With different approaches and implementing different sub-models to capture the essential multiphase and multiscale phenomena in these systems, major advances have been achieved, even though most models are only subject to a practical validation of macroscopic parameters. The current description of fluidized beds through mathematical models relies on the inclusion of vast sub-models, leading to an unquantifiable degree of uncertainty on the models' applicability for extrapolation studies. Furthermore, each closure and fitting parameter in the model represents a possible source of deviation, and their optimization, hence, becomes another major challenge. The recent advances in measurement techniques can enable us to troubleshoot and optimize the implemented models and sub-models based on local scale measurements. Local multiphase hydrodynamic information obtained by advanced measurement techniques can enable the validation of local predictions and optimization of the coupled sub-models, leading to the development of simplified and highly predictive models. Thus, pairing advanced experimental studies on these systems with insightful modeling approaches is required to advance the shortcoming and enhance the predictive quality of the models.

The extracts restored the altered total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate aminotransferase AST, total protein, and albumin. Histopathological architecture, DNA fragmentation, and mRNA expression level of TGF-beta 1 also confirmed the anti-fibrotic activity of the two extracts. The total phenolic content (TPC) in C. oliviforme ethanol extract exceeded that in C. caimito. Additionally, the malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels assured the antioxidant potential. Seven phenolics; quercetin, isoquercitrin, myricetin, kaempferol, and caffeic, trans-ferulic, and gallic acids were isolated from the ethanol extract of C. oliviforme. The molecular docking of isolated compounds revealed a low binding energy (kcal/mol with TGF-beta 1, thus confirming the hepatoprotctive activity of the extracts.

Classification and status monitoring of agricultural crops in central Morocco: a synergistic combination of OBIA approach and fused Landsat-Sentinel-2 data,"['Htitiou, A', ' Boudhar, A', ' Lebrini, Y', ' Lionboui, H', ' Chehbouni, A', ' Benabdelouahab, T']","Crop type mapping provides essential information to control and make decisions related to agricultural practices and their regulations. To map crop types accurately, it is important to capture their phenological stages and fine spatial details, especially in a temporally and spatially heterogeneous landscape. The data availability of new generation multispectral sensors of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites offers unprecedented options for such applications. Given this, our study aims to display how the synergistic use of these optical sensors can efficiently support crop type mapping research while integrating an object-based image analysis (OBIA). Through the applied methods, we used the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data-fusion model (FSDAF) to blend L8 and S2 data and obtain reliable normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets with fine spatial and temporal resolution. Then the crop phenological information was extracted using a Savitzky-Golay filter and fused NDVI time series. Finally, a model combining phenological metrics and fused reconstructed NDVI as classification features was developed using a random forest (RF) classifier/OBIA approach. The results show that the FSDAF method creates more accurate fused NDVI and keeps more spatial details than ESTARFM. The FSDAF model was then used to create fused, high-resolution time-series products that were able to extract crop phenology in single-crop fields while providing a very detailed pattern relative to that from individual sensor time-series data. Moreover, combined L8 and S2 data by FSDAF produced highly significant overall classification accuracies (90.03% for pixel-based RF to 93.12% OBIA RF), outperforming individual sensor use (82.57% for L8-only; 88.45% for S2-only). Our proposed workflow highlights the advantage of spatiotemporal fusing and OBIA environment in spatiotemporally heterogeneous areas and fragmented landscapes, which represents a promising step toward generating fast, accurate, and ready-to-use agricultural data products.

In this study, a new Multilevel Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) model is proposed to analyze and predict multiply-nested and hierarchical data. Temperature and rainfall observation were carried out successively between 1979-2014 and 1984-2018; and the data input was organized on monthly basis for each year. Besides, a daily observation was made for Dar Chaoui zone of Northern Morocco. However, we chose in the first time a simple linear regression model, but the estimation has been just for fixed effects and ignoring the random effect. On the other hand, in multi level linear mixed effects models, once the model has been formulated, methods are needed to estimate the model parameters. In this section, we first deal with the joint estimation of the fixed effects (beta), random effects (ui) and then with estimation of the variance parameters (gamma, rho and sigma(2)). The study revealed that the predicted values are very close to the real value. Besides, this model is capable of modelling the error, fixed and random parts of the sample. Moreover, in this range, the results showed that there is three standard deviations measures for fixed and random effects, also the variance measure, which demonstrate us a great prediction. In conclusion, this model gives a decisive precision of results that can be exploited in studies for forecast of water balance and/or soil erosion.

In this paper, for the first time, investigations on the difference between the cleaning strategy for both a CSP power plant and a PV system installed at the same climate conditions in the mid-south of Morocco were carried out. The most convenient cleaning scenario was identified through the analysis of the cleaning costs and the energy losses, by taking into account different parameters of the site specifications.

As financial resources for restoration are limited, identifying areas where resources can be used efficiently to achieve particular restoration objectives is critical. This study presents a rapid approach to identifying and prioritizing degraded agricultural lands for low-cost ecological recovery. Using publicly available remote sensing datasets at the national level, we apply the proposed methodology to Colombia, where we identify opportunities for cost-effective interventions on productive lands with moderate to light degradation, based on biophysical indicators of soil degradation. In tandem, we identify areas experiencing underutilization, where SLUS can be used to sustainably intensify production, and overutilization, where SLUS can be used to mitigate soil degradation. We identify and map over 10.3 million ha of land with potential for ecological recovery. We find that the Caribbean region proportionally has a high prevalence of moderately degraded agricultural and agroforestry soils, while the Andean region has a high proportion of moderately degraded production forestry soils.

We hypothesized that PSB effects on plant growth may be greater on root traits that positively links with aboveground physiology more than the commonly believed rhizosphere P bio-solubilization. In this study, five contrasting PSB (Pseudomonasspp.) isolates (low PSB1, moderate PSB(2)and PSB4 and high PSB(3)and PSB5 P-solubilizing capacity PSC) were used to investigate above- and below-ground responses in wheat fertilized with rock P (RP) under controlled conditions.

This assessment involves collecting and processing hydrological data to provide reliable information on water resources' status and evolution. However, the non-availability and lack of hydrological data constrain the process of this assessment. Therefore, we propose in this work to adopt a clustering analysis based-regionalization approach combining multivariate data analysis (PCA) and clustering algorithms (HAC and KM) to delineate watersheds' homogeneous clusters. Clustering analysis produces groups of watersheds based on their similarity which will allow the transfer of data from gauged sites to ungauged sites. At the end of the present study, 6 clusters of watersheds were identified. These identified clusters have their characteristics in terms of surface, perimeter, length of the equivalent rectangle, time of concentration, and land use.

Mechanical properties are evaluated in terms of tensile stiffness and strength of fiber tows before, during and after the plating process. The effect of the treatment on the molecular structure of fibers is investigated by measuring their thermal stability with differential scanning calorimetry and obtaining Raman spectra of fibers at different stages of the treatment. Results show that the last stage in the electroless process (the plating step) is the most detrimental, causing changes in fibers' properties. Fibers seem to lose their structural integrity and develop surface defects that result in a substantial loss in their mechanical strength. However, repeating the process more than once or elongating the residence time in the plating bath does not show a further negative effect on the strength but contributes to the increase in the copper coating thickness, and, subsequently, the final stiffness of the tows. Monitoring the changes in resistance values with applied strain on a model composite made of these conductive tows show an excellent correlation between the increase in strain and increase in electrical resistance. These results indicate that these fibers show potential when combined with conventional composites of glass or carbon fibers as structure monitoring devices without largely affecting their mechanical performance.","['regenerated cellulose fibers (RCFs)', ' electroless copper plating', ' conductive cellulose fibers', ' mechanical properties', ' molecular structure', ' functional composites']",2021.0,MATERIALS,"['Chemistry', ' Materials Science', ' Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering', ' Physics']","['STINT', 'SMM', 'ERDF']",False,3,False,31

Furthermore, the inoculation treatment significantly shaped the fungal communities in soil and increased the number of AMF ASVs in clary sage roots. In addition, clary sage cultivation over successive years could be one of the explanatory parameters for the inter-annual variation in both fungal and AMF communities in the soil and root biotopes.

During the last decades, the cultivation of date palm and its development are threatened by several constraints, in particular, organic and mineral matter depletion. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a seaweed extract (SWE) derived from the brown algae Fucus spiralis and an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) strain (Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 197198) as well as their combination on the growth and development of the date palm (P. dactylifera L.). Growth, physiological, and histological parameters were evaluated. The results show that AMF combined with SWE induced the greatest effect. Indeed this treatment significantly increased the total dry weight, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) levels by 27, 36, 48, 377, and 94%, respectively, compared to the control. Potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) contents were highly increased by AMF compared to other treatments. The results also show an enhancement in quantum yield of the photochemistry of PSII (Fv/Fm) by the AMF, SWE, and AMF+SWE treatments. The number of sclerenchyma fibers in AMF+SWE, SWE, and AMF treatments was increased by 681, 164 and 154% respectively, while, the number of vascular bundles was improved by 24% in the SWE treatment compared to the control. Lastly, the results indicated the positive effect of SWE or AMF and, especially, their combination as an efficient practice to improve growth and development of date palm. (C) 2020 SAAB.

Work-based learning: an approach towards entrepreneurial advancement,"['Ahmad, AM', ' Hussain, K', ' Ekiz, E', ' Tang, T']","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to promote the adoption of a work-based learning (WBL) approach by highlighting the benefits to students, organizations and the economy. Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a review and synthesis of current literature, including two separate case studies, which serve to demonstrate the practical applications of entrepreneurial education in different countries and how this application works to strengthen economies and improve communities. Findings Learning entrepreneurship in a real-world environment can bridge the gap between traditional, classroom instruction and idea-driven product and service development. It is a business-effective approach that achieves measurable results. Traditional education, typified by mastery of facts and evaluation by testing, can morph into creative, research-inspired solutions that fulfill public and private organizational needs. Success is irrefutable, measured by tangible results. In WBL, students can use industry-standard technologies and collaborate with mentors, clients and customers. They can work as individuals and in teams, with their entrepreneurial education beginning as early as elementary school. In the process, students learn to be motivated by their own achievements, rather than grades. They learn to engage in creative problem-solving, based upon current data, and measure their ability to deal with challenge and failure through an iterative process of problem-solving. Originality/value The completion of this research study serves to highlight the potential benefits that Malaysia could attain through the adoption of WBL within the country's school systems.","['Malaysia', ' Education', ' Entrepreneurship', ' Work-Based Learning']",2020.0,WORLDW HOSP TOUR THE,['Social Sciences - Other Topics'],[''],False,1,False,11
Antioxidant Activity Improvement of Apples Juice Supplemented with Chitosan-Galactose Maillard Reaction Products,"['Hafsa, J', ' Smach, MA', ' Sobeh, M', ' Majdoub, H', ' Yasri, A']","Chitosan-galactose Maillard reaction (CG) were prepared by heating at 100 degrees C for 3 hrs in a model system containing chitosan (CH) and 1%, 1.5% and 2% (w/v) of galactose. The results showed that the absorbance at 294 and 420 nm, the fluorescence intensity and the color differences of CG Maillard reaction products (MRPs) increased significantly with the increase of galactose concentration, which indicated the development of MRPs. In addition, FT-IR analysis showed that the degree of deacetylation of CG-MRPs was reduced with the increasing galactose ratio by the schiff base (-C=N) formation, indicating that the galactose has been attached to the amino group of chitosan. Likewise, the antioxidant activities (DPPH, chelating ability and reducing power) of CG-MRPs were investigated. Notably, the effect of galactose concentration in CG-MRPs was found to enhance the antioxidant activity, indicating that CG-2% exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in the range of 0.25-2.0 mg/mL. Furthermore, the apple juice supplemented with CG-MRPs could significantly improve the antioxidant activities, and CG-2% in apple juice showed the better antioxidant capacity at the concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Thus, we conclude that CG-MRPs addition may greatly improve the antioxidant quality of apple juice.","['chitosan', ' galactose', ' Maillard reaction', ' apple juice', ' antioxidant', 'FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES', ' DERIVATIVES', ' FRUCTOSE', ' CHITIN', ' ACID']",2019.0,MOLECULES,"['Biochemistry & Molecular Biology', ' Chemistry']",[''],False,1,False,35
A well-balanced positivity-preserving numerical scheme for shallow water models with variable density,"['Hanini, A', ' Beljadid, A', ' Ouazar, D']","We develop an unstructured numerical scheme for a coupled system modeling shallow water flows and solute transport over variable topography. A novel algorithm is introduced for the reconstructions of the variables of the system with variable density. These reconstructions are used in combination with the expression of the relative density of the mixture to guarantee the positivity required for some physical parameters of the coupled model. New discretization techniques are developed to guarantee the well-balanced property of the scheme and the consistency between the transport equation and the continuity equation at the discrete level. We prove the well-balanced property of the proposed method as well as the positivity preserving property of the scheme for both the water depth and concentrations. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested on a number of numerical examples, among which we consider nontrivial analytical solutions for the equilibrium with mixture constituents, parabolic wave with pollutant transport, and dam-break problem for modeling solute transport in rapidly varying flow.

Substitution of Cement with Granulated Blast Furnace Slag in Cemented Paste Backfill: Evaluation of Technical and Chemical Properties,"['Solismaa, S', ' Torppa, A', ' Kuva, J', ' Heikkila, P', ' Hyvonen, S', ' Juntunen, P', ' Benzaazoua, M', ' Kauppila, T']","Cemented paste backfill (CPB) offers an environmentally sustainable way to utilize mine tailings, one of the largest waste streams in the world. CPB is a support and filler material used in underground mine cavities, which consists of mine tailings, water, and binder material that usually is cement. Replacing cement with secondary raw materials like granulated blast-furnace slag reduces the total CO2 emissions and strengthens the internal microstructure of the CPB. This study characterizes the total- and soluble contents of CPB starting materials and five CPB specimens containing different levels of slag substitution. In addition, phase composition (mineral liberation analysis, MLA) and internal structure (X-ray tomography) of five CPB specimens is documented, and measurements of compressive strength are used to evaluate their suitability as backfill material. Mine tailings and CPB specimens used in this study are rich in sulphates and arsenic, but low in sulphides. Stronger As leaching of ground CPB specimens compared with ground mine tailings is related to the elevating pore water pH during the cement hydration. The hydration product ettringite is found in all CPB specimens and its content is the lowest in the slag containing specimens. X-ray tomography revealed vertically differentiated density structures in the CPB specimens. The lower parts of all specimens are denser in comparison with the upper parts, which is probably due to the compaction of the solid particles at the base. The compressive strength test results indicate that partial substitution of cement with slag improves the strength of the CPB. The total replacement of cement with slag reduces the early strength but gives excellent strength and lower porosity over longer time intervals. The results of the study can be utilized in developing more durable and environmentally responsible CPB recipes for gold mines of similar mineral composition and gold extraction method.</p>","['cemented paste backfill', ' mine tailings', ' cement', ' granulated blast furnace slag', ' mining environments', ' circular economy', 'MINE', ' HYDRATION', ' WASTE', ' PH']",2021.0,MINERALS-BASEL,"['Geochemistry & Geophysics', ' Mineralogy', ' Mining & Mineral Processing']","['European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission [A75014]', ' Geological Survey of Finland', ' Agnico Eagle Finland Ltd.', ' Kuopion Energia Ltd.', ' Finnsementti Ltd.', ' Yara Suomi Ltd.', 'UK', ' Endomines Ltd.']",False,8,False,38
Numerical simulation of the performance of passive and active solar still with corrugated absorber surface as heat storage medium for sustainable solar desalination technology,"['Hafs, H', ' Asbik, M', ' Boushaba, H', ' Koukouch, A', ' Zaaoumi, A', ' Bah, A', ' Ansari, O']","Groundwater is the most important and valuable water resource in arid and semi-arid regions. Nevertheless, the high salinity of these resources remains the major constraint. To remedy this problem, the present study aims to investigate and develop a novel sustainable solar desalination technology. A passive and active single slope solar still, combined with phase change material (PCM) for the thermal energy storage system, have been numerically modeled and simulated. The active system has been made by coupling passive solar still with a parabolic trough collector (PTC) via a heat exchanger, as an external heat source. For each desalination system, a flat absorber and others with corrugated surfaces (rectangular, triangular, and spherical) were tested to compare their performances and the effect of absorber shape on both passive and active systems. Conservation equations of the two models were solved using Comsol Multiphysics software. Simulation results showed that for the passive system the corrugated surface with rectangular ripples increases pure water productivity by 109% and 42% by comparison with the conventional distiller, and the distiller with an absorber of flatform with storage system, respectively. Furthermore, it was revealed that solar still integrated with PTC and modified by different absorber geometry has higher freshwater productivity of 15.39 and 15.01 kg/m(2)/day compared to 2.37 and 2.11 kg/m(2)/ day for the passive still by using rectangular and spherical absorbers respectively. Consequently, the percentage improvement of the developed active system is about 549.36% and 611.37% respectively. From this investigation, it is observed that the passive solar still with rectangular absorber is the most suitable for household use; however, by coupling PTC to the modified passive solar still with rectangular absorber configuration, we have the appropriate design for industrial applications such as hospitals, irrigation processes for agricultural greenhouses in arid and semi arid regions.","['Desalination solar still', ' Sustainability', ' Absorber shape', ' Parabolic through collector', ' Daily productivity', ' Comsol multiphysics', 'PARABOLIC CONCENTRATOR', ' EXPERIMENTAL WORK', ' SYSTEM', ' ENERGY', ' NANOFLUIDS', ' COLLECTOR', ' EXERGY']",2021.0,GROUNDWATER SUST DEV,"['Engineering', ' Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Water Resources']",[''],False,1,False,54

In this paper, we argue that the distinctive features of human culture derive from humans' unique skills and motivations for coordinating with one another around different types of action and information. As different levels of these skills of 'shared intentionality' emerged over the last several hundred thousand years, human culture became characterized first by such things as collaborative activities and pedagogy based on cooperative communication, and then by such things as collaborative innovations and normatively structured pedagogy. As a kind of capstone of this trajectory, humans began to coordinate not just on joint actions and shared beliefs, but on the reasons for what we believe or how we act. Coordinating on reasons powered the kinds of extremely rapid innovation and stable cumulative cultural evolution especially characteristic of the human species in the last several tens of thousands of years.

The Aromatic Plant Clary Sage Shaped Bacterial Communities in the Roots and in the Trace Element-Contaminated Soil More Than Mycorrhizal Inoculation - A Two-Year Monitoring Field Trial,"['Raveau, R', ' Fontaine, J', ' Hijri, M', ' Sahraoui, ALH']","To cope with soil contamination by trace elements (TE), phytomanagement has attracted much attention as being an eco-friendly and cost-effective green approach. In this context, aromatic plants could represent a good option not only to immobilize TE, but also to use their biomass to extract essential oils, resulting in high added-value products suitable for non-food valorization. However, the influence of aromatic plants cultivation on the bacterial community structure and functioning in the rhizosphere microbiota remains unknown. Thus, the present study aims at determining in TE-aged contaminated soil (Pb - 394 ppm, Zn - 443 ppm, and Cd - 7ppm, respectively, 11, 6, and 17 times higher than the ordinary amounts in regional agricultural soils) the effects of perennial clary sage (Salvia sclarea L.) cultivation, during two successive years of growth and inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, on rhizosphere bacterial diversity and community structure. Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing targeting bacterial 16S rRNA gene was used to assess bacterial diversity and community structure changes. Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing datasets resulted in 4691 and 2728 bacterial Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) in soil and root biotopes, respectively. Our findings have shown that the cultivation of clary sage displayed a significant year-to-year effect, on both bacterial richness and community structures. We found that the abundance of plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria significantly increased in roots during the second growing season. However, we didn't observe any significant effect of mycorrhizal inoculation neither on bacterial diversity nor on community structure.

These systems include three silicon technologies. The analysis is based on the performance parameters described in the international standard IEC 61724. To perform this comparative analysis, the energy production, the operational and the meteorological data are first collected for a period of time. The performance evaluation of PV plants is then performed based on several performance indicators such as Final Yield, Performance Ratio, System Losses, Capture Losses, Array Efficiency and Capacity Factor. Using the PCA method, the correlation between the performance parameters and the meteorological variables is then studied and analyzed. The resulting analysis shows that the Polycrystalline silicon technology is the most performing one. The annual average values of the Performance Ratio were found to be 86.66% for the polycrystalline against 84.76% and 83%, for the monocrystalline and amorphous, respectively. For the daily data, the PCA method reveals that the Performance Ratio is independent of the solar irradiation but it has a slight correlation with temperature and System Losses and a strong correlation with Capture Losses. The result shows also that the temperature acts slightly on the amorphous compared to the crystalline ones. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Role of Organic Anions and Phosphatase Enzymes in Phosphorus Acquisition in the Rhizospheres of Legumes and Grasses Grown in a Low Phosphorus Pasture Soil,"['Touhami, D', ' McDowell, RW', ' Condron, LM']","Rhizosphere processes play a critical role in phosphorus (P) acquisition by plants and microbes, especially under P-limited conditions. Here, we investigated the impacts of nutrient addition and plant species on plant growth, rhizosphere processes, and soil P dynamics. In a glasshouse experiment, blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius), white clover (Trifolium repensL.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenneL.), and wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) were grown in a low-P pasture soil for 8 weeks with and without the single and combined addition of P (33 mg kg(-1)) and nitrogen (200 mg kg(-1)). Phosphorus addition increased plant biomass and total P content across plant species, as well as microbial biomass P in white clover and ryegrass. Alkaline phosphatase activity was higher for blue lupin. Legumes showed higher concentrations of organic anions compared to grasses. After P addition, the concentrations of organic anions increased by 11-,10-, 5-, and 2-fold in the rhizospheres of blue lupin, white clover, wheat, and ryegrass, respectively. Despite the differences in their chemical availability (as assessed by P fractionation), moderately labile inorganic P and stable organic P were the most depleted fractions by the four plant species. Inorganic P fractions were depleted similarly between the four plant species, while blue lupin exhibited a strong depletion of stable organic P. Our findings suggest that organic anions were not related to the acquisition of inorganic P for legumes and grasses. At the same time, alkaline phosphatase activity was associated with the mobilization of stable organic P for blue lupin.","['phosphorus acquisition', ' organic anions', ' phosphatase enzymes', ' rhizosphere P fractions', ' legumes', ' grasses', 'MICROBIAL BIOMASS-P', ' CARBOXYLATE EXUDATION', ' NITROGEN ADDITION', ' ALUMINUM TOLERANCE', ' ACID-PHOSPHATASE', ' FRACTIONS', ' PLANT', ' FOREST', ' WHEAT', ' AVAILABILITY']",2020.0,PLANTS-BASEL,['Plant Sciences'],"['VI', 'OCP', 'CX']",True,3,True,126

WR are mainly characterised by the high heterogeneity of their hydrogeological, mineralogical and physical proprieties. The main objectives of this study consist of: i) a detailed characterisation of WR from Canadian Malartic mine in Malartic city (Quebec, Canada), ii) the use of environmental desulphurisation of the three classified waste rocks main lithologies to reduce their acid generation potential and iii) the recovery of the residual precious metals (e.g. Au, Ag). The studied materials were sampled after blasting while ensuring their representativity. Each lithology was first screened based on the DPLS (diameter of physical locking of sulphides) to remove the inert fraction higher than 2.4 mm. Then, the fraction (< 2.4 mm) was separated into two fractions to optimize their integrated management 0-1 mm referenced as fine fraction and 1-2.4 mm referenced as coarse fraction. Chemical and mineralogical determinations showed that the three lithologies are more enriched in carbonates (mainly as calcite) than sulphides (mainly as pyrite). The acid base accounting (ABA) testing and the net acid generation (NAG) tests both showed that these lithologies (< 2.4 mm) and their corresponding fractions are non-acid generating except three fractions that are uncertain. In order to reduce the sulphur content, desulphurisation applied on the fraction < 2.4 mm using laboratory gravity separation (Knelson separator and Mozley table) was more efficient than flotation. All desulphurised materials from gravity and flotation methods were in the non-acid generating zone. The gravity method offered a sulphur recovery of about 84 wt%.

Indeed, the role of metallo-resistant bacteria in lessening heavy metal toxicity was investigated. For this purpose, solutions of Cu, Pb, and Zn were used at the rate of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mM for 4 d, along with untreated control using distilled water. The obtained findings displayed the stronger inhibitory effect of heavy metals on the germination and rhizogenesis process as well as a significant mito-depressive effect in the meristematic cells. For instance, Cu at the rate of 2.5 mM inhibited seed germination by 95 %, root elongation fell from 2.25 (in the control) to 0.14, while the mitotic index was reduced by 155%. Moreover, inoculation with metallo-resistant bacteria attenuated heavy metal toxicity, increased germination, rhizogenesis, mitotic index, and thus plant early growth. Metallo-resistant rhizobacteria inoculation improved the germination percentage by 40 % in the case of Cu and by 24 % in the case of Zn. The overall results suggest the cytotoxicity and the genotoxicity potential of Cu, Pb, and Zn on plants even at low concentrations.

Willows Used for Phytoremediation Increased Organic Contaminant Concentrations in Soil Surface,"['Faubert, MF', ' Desjardins, D', ' Hijri, M', ' Labrecque, M']","Featured Application Field phytoremediation with willow shrub (Salix spp.). The Salix genus includes shrub species that are widely used in phytoremediation and various other phytotechnologies due to their advantageous characteristics, such as a high evapotranspiration (ET) rate, in particular when cultivated in short rotation intensive culture (SRIC). Observations made in past field studies suggest that ET and its impact on soil hydrology can also lead to increases in soil pollutant concentrations near shrubs. To investigate this, sections of a mature willow plantation (seven years old) were cut to eliminate transpiration (Cut treatment). Soil concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), aliphatic compounds C10-C50, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and five trace elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn) were compared between the Cut and the uncut plots (Salix miyabeana 'SX61'). Over 24 months, the results clearly show that removal of the willow shrubs limited the contaminants' increase in the soil surface, as observed for C10-C50 and of 10 PAHs under the Salix treatment. This finding strongly reinforces a hypothesis that SRIC of willows may facilitate the migration of contaminants towards their roots, thus increasing their concentration in the surrounding soil. Such a pumping effect in a high-density willow crop is a prominent characteristic specific to field studies that can lead to counterintuitive results. Although apparent increases of contaminant concentrations contradict the purification benefits usually pursued in phytoremediation, the possibility of active phytoextraction and rhizodegradation is not excluded.

Herein, the Codium decorticatum alga (CDA) was biologically identified and used as a biosorbent for anionic and cationic dyes from aqueous solutions. SEM analysis showed a rough surface with an irregular edge and shape while hydroxyl, amine, sulfur and carboxyl functional groups were identified using FTIR analysis. TGA/DTG confirmed the stability of CDA and the adsorption process. Batch studies were conducted to investigate the effect of operational factors such as initial pH, biosorbent dosage, temperature, initial concentration, and solid/liquid contact time on the biosorption of crystal violet (CV) and Congo red (CR) dyes. For both CV and CR dyes, the biosorption kinetics was accurately described by the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir isotherm was found to be best fitted for equilibrium data. Maximum uptake capacities have attained up to 278.46 mg/g for CV and 191.01 mg/g for CR. The CV and CR dye biosorption mechanism was ultimately manifested through the electrostatic interactions. The regeneration study showed that the CDA presents excellent reuse performance up to four consecutive cycles. The process optimization was performed using the response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design (RSM-BDD). Accordingly, the optimum predicted removal efficiencies using RSM-BBD for CV and CR were obtained, respectively, at 96.9 and 89.8% using a CDA dose of 1.5 g/L, dye concentration of 20 mg/L, pH of 10 for CV, and pH of 4 for CR. Overall, CDA behaves as an efficient, recyclable, cheap, and eco-friendly adsorbent for cleaning-up of dyed effluents.","['RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY', ' AQUEOUS-SOLUTION', ' CONGO RED', ' ATLANTIC COASTS', ' CRYSTAL VIOLET', ' REACTIVE DYES', ' ANIONIC DYES', ' CATIONIC DYE', ' REMOVAL', ' BIOSORPTION']",2020.0,ACS OMEGA,['Chemistry'],[''],False,1,False,75

This process requires continuous agitation to avoid fouling problems and sludge deposition. The current work aims to investigate the well mixedness in the desupersaturation tank for optimal performance. For this purpose, a multi-fluid CFD study was conducted based on the Euler-Euler modeling approach, considering a multiphase flow involving a liquid phase (phosphoric acid) and a poly-dispersed solid phase, i.e. a sludge with three different sizes where each size is considered as a separate phase. First, the hydrodynamic behavior of the flow within the agitated desupersaturator is analyzed through the investigation of the velocity fields as well as the power and pumping numbers, to determine both the agitator capacity to pump the flow and its power consumption during the operation. Then, in order to assess themixture homogeneity, we evaluated the solid suspension in the desupersaturation reactor following conventional methods and two new proposed methodologies: the first approach is to evaluate the suspension quality in the mixing system by compartment and the second consists on the assessment of the uniform convergence of the solid concentration. Furthermore, we calculated the time required to achieve a full suspension at different solid concentrations. On other hand, we conducted a detailed analysis of the solid distribution dependency on the impeller rotational speed at different solid volume fraction, which allows a good understanding of the parameters controlling the homogenization in the desupersaturator.

The combination of hydrophobic character of PCL as biodegradable polymer and the swelling behavior of guar gum (GG) and halloysite nanotubes (HNT) as natural fillers were evaluated in this study with a view of the slow release of fertilizers. Indeed, the hydroxyl groups on the guar gum (GG) and halloysite (HNTs) surfaces act as initiators for caprolactone in situ ring opening polymerization and the developing polymers are covalently grafted to the GG and HNTs.

Proof of Concept: Calibration of an Overhead Line Conductors' Movements Simulation Model Using Ensemble-Based Machine Learning Model,"['Amroun, H', ' Ammi, M', ' Hafid, F']","In this paper, we present a new approach to use machine learning (ML) for the calibration of a physical model allowing the reproduction of the vibratory behavior of an overhead line conductor.

A second model known as the Wake Oscillator (WO) has been implemented in order to meet the limitations of the ST model. In order to be able to use the WO model instead of the ST model, very heavy manual adjustments are required, which makes its use complicated. Precisely, the WO must be able to generate a time series similar to a time series generated by the ST model. In order to respond to this limitation, a machine learning model known as ENS has been proposed. The machine learning model will therefore take as input the data from the WO model and output the data from the ST model. A series of Machine learning models have been implemented and tested. The ENS algorithm was retained with a best Pearson's linear coefficient of determination (R2 Score) of almost 0.7 and a Root mean square deviation (RMSE) of 7.57e-09.

Among these processes, pyrolysis has attracted attention since it enables the production and chemical recovery. In this context, the use of date stones as a raw material for the production of bio-oil and biochar using a fixed-bed reactor is investigated. The pyrolysis process was performed by varying three parameters: temperature (400-600 degrees C), heating rate (10-50 degrees C.min(-1)), and particle size (0.5-1.5 mm).

This study investigated the influence of [K2O/(CaO+MgO)] ratio variation on glass properties. For this, the elaborated glasses have undergone a chemical characterization using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, a thermal characterization using differential thermal analysis, a physicochemical characterization based on density and molar volume measurements, and a structural characterization using Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.

The Relationship between Soil Moisture and Soil Water Repellency Persistence in Hydrophobic Soils,"['Bayad, M', ' Chau, HW', ' Trolove, S', ' Moir, J', ' Condron, L', ' Bouray, M']","In this work, we modelled the response of soil water repellency (SWR) persistence to the decrease in moisture in drying soils, and we explored the implication of soil particle size distribution and specific surface area on the SWR severity and persistence. A new equation for the relationship between SWR persistence and soil moisture (theta) is described in this paper. The persistence of SWR was measured on ten different hydrophobic soils using water drop penetration time (WDPT) at decreasing levels of gravimetric water content. The actual repellency persistence showed a sigmoidal response to soil moisture decrease, where R-a(theta)=Rp/1+e(delta(theta-theta c)). The suggested equation enables one to model the actual SWR persistence (R-a) using theta, the potential repellency (R-p) and two characteristic parameters related to the shape of the response curve. The two parameters are the critical soil moisture theta(c), where the R-a increase rate reaches its maximum, and the parameter delta affecting the steepness of the curve at the inflexion point of the sigmoidal curve.

A Primal Adjacency-Based Algorithm for the Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints,"['Himmich, I', ' Ben Amor, H', ' El Hallaoui, I', ' Soumis, F']","The shortest path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC) is often used as a subproblem within a column-generation approach for routing and scheduling problems. It aims to find a least-cost path between the source and the destination nodes in a network while satisfying the resource consumption limitations on every node.

Such approaches are effective in practice, but they can be inefficient when the network is large and especially when the number of resources is high. To cope with this major drawback, we propose a new exact primal algorithm to solve the SPPRC defined on acyclic networks.

Nitrogen fertilization effects on soil phosphorus dynamics under a grass-pasture system,"['Touhami, D', ' McDowell, RW', ' Condron, LM', ' Bouray, M']","Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are critical to pasture productivity; however, limited information is available on how the single and combined additions of N and P affect soil P fractions and seasonal changes in microbial and biochemical processes linked to P cycling under pasture systems. A two-year field trial was conducted where N (0 or 250 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and P (0 or 50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were applied in a full factorial design to an intensively managed grass-pasture system. Changes in plant growth and nutrient uptake, soil microbial biomass P, soil phosphatase activities, and soil inorganic and organic P fractions were assessed by regular sampling. Phosphorus addition increased Olsen P and shoot P uptake but not shoot biomass compared to the control. In contrast, N addition decreased Olsen P by 23% but increased both shoot biomass and P uptake by 1.6-fold, compared to the control. Microbial biomass P was irresponsive to N and P additions. Phosphatase enzyme activity significantly increased in summer under N addition, which was linked to labile organic P mineralization. After two growing seasons, N addition alone significantly decreased readily-available inorganic P, labile inorganic P, moderately labile inorganic P, and labile organic P by 75, 19, 7, and 28%, respectively, compared to the control. On the other hand, combined N and P addition significantly decreased readily-available inorganic P, labile inorganic P, and labile organic P by 39, 26, and 28%, respectively, but had no impact on moderately labile inorganic P compared to P addition alone. The findings of this study revealed that short-term N fertilization to N-limited grass-pastures can accelerate P cycling by mobilizing labile inorganic and organic P as well as moderately labile inorganic P pools.

An enriched Galerkin-characteristics finite element method for convection-dominated and transport problems,"['Ouardghi, A', ' El-Amrani, M', ' Seaid, M']","We propose an enriched Galerkin-characteristics finite element method for numerical solution of convection-dominated problems. The method uses the modified method of characteristics for the integration of the total derivative in time, combined with the finite element method for the spatial discretization on unstructured grids. The L-2-projection method is implemented for the evaluation of numerical solutions by tracking the departure points from the integration points in each element. In the present study, a family of quadrature rules are used to enrich the approximation of integrals in the L-2-projection method. The use of quadrature rules as an enrichment procedure allows for spatial discretizations on coarse fixed meshes and no need to introduce time-dependent enrichments. This procedure offers a very great advantage over the conventional Galerkin-characteristics finite element method since the same governing matrix representation can be used during the entire time steeping process. We also propose a multilevel adaptive procedure in the enriched Galerkin-characteristics finite element method by monitoring the gradient of the solution in the computational domain during its advection. In comparison with the traditional finite element analysis with h-, p- and hp-version refinements, the present approach is much simpler, more robust and efficient, and it yields more accurate solutions for a fixed number of degrees of freedom without refining the mesh. To examine the performance of the proposed method we solve several test examples for convectiondiffusion problems. Comparison to the conventional Galerkin-characteristics finite element method is also carried out in the present work. The aim of such enriched method compared to the classical finite element method is to solve the time-dependent convection-dominated problems efficiently and with an appropriate level of accuracy.

According to compressibility parameters, initial moisture content and compaction characteristics, this study confirms first that the use of PG alone should be limited to ordinary embankments of heights less than 4 m. Secondly, the mix PG:SM = 40:60 allows to use a significant amount of raw PG while maintaining good performances in terms of fractal behaviour of particles size distribution, immersion resistance, load bearing capacity and compaction characteristics. This mix has also successfully passed the compressibility risk under loading effect on the embankments. Finally, the compatibility of the mix (CM:PG:SM):HRB = (10:25:65):7 for the capping and pavement layers use was confirmed. TCLP method was carried out on the stabilized mix samples to verify the contamination risk.","['Phosphogypsum', ' Compressive behaviour', ' Road engineering', ' Elastic modulus', ' Chemical stabilization', 'NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY', ' WASTE']",2020.0,J BUILD ENG,"['Construction & Building Technology', ' Engineering']",['OCP'],True,1,False,37
Assessing Soil Cover Levels during the Non-Growing Season Using Multitemporal Satellite Imagery and Spectral Unmixing Techniques,"['Laamrani, A', ' Joosse, P', ' McNairn, H', ' Berg, AA', ' Hagerman, J', ' Powell, K', ' Berry, M']","Growing cover or winter crops and retaining crop residue on agricultural lands are considered beneficial management practices to address soil health and water quality. Remote sensing is a valuable tool to assess and map crop residue cover and cover crops. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of linear spectral unmixing for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season (November-May) over the Canadian Lake Erie Basin using seasonal multitemporal satellite imagery. Soil cover ground measurements and multispectral Landsat-8 imagery were acquired for two areas throughout the 2015-2016 non-growing season. Vertical soil cover photos were collected from up to 40 residue and 30 cover crop fields for each area (e.g., Elgin and Essex sites) when harvest, cloud, and snow conditions permitted. Images and data were reviewed and compiled to represent a complete coverage of the basin for three time periods (post-harvest, pre-planting, and post-planting). The correlations between field measured and satellite imagery estimated soil covers (e.g., residue and green) were evaluated by coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Overall, spectral unmixing of satellite imagery is well suited for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season. Spectral unmixing using three-endmembers (i.e., corn residue-soil-green cover; soybean residue-soil-green cover) showed higher correlations with field measured soil cover than spectral unmixing using two- or four-endmembers. For the nine non-growing season images analyzed, the residue and green cover fractions derived from linear spectral unmixing using corn residue-soil-green cover endmembers were highly correlated with the field-measured data (mean R-2 of 0.70 and 0.86, respectively). The results of this study support the use of remote sensing and spectral unmixing techniques for monitoring performance metrics for government initiatives, such as the Canada-Ontario Lake Erie Action Plan, and as input for sustainability indicators that both require knowledge about non-growing season land management over a large area.","['agricultural land', ' southwestern Ontario', ' crop residue', ' winter cover crop', ' Landsat-8 imagery', ' unmixing', ' classification techniques', ' validation', ' land cover', 'CROP RESIDUE COVER', ' HYPERION', ' LANDSAT', ' MAIZE']",2020.0,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,"['Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Geology', ' Remote Sensing', ' Imaging Science & Photographic Technology']","['Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Growing Forward 2 fundAgriculture & Agri Food Canada', 'BMPVD']",False,2,False,49

uCARE Chem Suite and uCAREChemSuiteCLI: Tools for bacterial resistome prediction,"['Saha, SB', ' Gupta, VK', ' Ramteke, PW']","In the era of antibiotic resistance, in silico prediction of bacterial resistome profiles, likely to be associated with inactivation of new potential antibiotics is of utmost importance. Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, no tool exists for such prediction. Therefore, under the rationale that drugs with similar structures have similar resistome profiles, we developed two models, a deterministic model and a stochastic model, to predict the bacterial resistome likely to neutralize uncharacterized but potential chemical structures. The current version of the tool involves the prediction of a resistome for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The deterministic model on omitting two diverse but relatively less characterized drug classes, polyketides and polypeptides showed an accuracy of 87%, a sensitivity of 85%, and a precision of 89%, whereas the stochastic model predicted antibiotic classes of the test set compounds with an accuracy of 72%, a sensitivity of 75%, and a precision of 83%. The models have been implemented in both a standalone package and an online server, uCAREChemSuiteCLI and uCARE Chem Suite, respectively. In addition to resistome prediction, the online version of the suite enables the user to visualize the chemical structure, classify compounds in 19 predefined drug classes, perform pairwise alignment, and cluster with database compounds using a graphical user interface.

Statistical modeling of geopolymers from dual-alkali activation of un-calcined phosphate sludge and their potential applications as sustainable coating materials,"['Hamdane, H', ' Tamraoui, Y', ' Mansouri, S', ' Oumam, M', ' Bouih, A', ' El Ghailassi, T', ' Boulif, R', ' Manoun, B', ' Hannache, H']","Upcycling phosphate mining sludges to produce a green cementitious binder, called geopolymer, has recently been implemented; although interesting, a thermal activation has been required to increase their reactivity, in detriment of the energy consumption, environmental footprint and costs. This paper provides an innovative approach to phosphate sludge disposal without any thermal activation, through a dual-alkali activation of NaOH-KOH for designing sustainable geopolymer coating binder of metakaolin with up-to 50 wt% replacement by un-calcined phosphate sludge (UPS). RSM-based statistical design was undertaken to optimize and understand the influence of design factors of activator modulus (M-S), ageing time and thermal curing on compressive strength, apparent porosity and water absorption as targeted properties, through polynomial models. Optimal geopolymer testing included measurements of initialfinal setting time and durability against 5% NaCl, 5% Na2SO4 and 2% HCI attack up to 3 months, through the visual examination, weight loss and flexural strength.The microstructures of the optimal binder highlighted significant changes in the geopolymeric network, including the formation of hybrid type gels (N,K)-A-S-H or (C,N,K)-A-S-H, silica gel and C-A-S-H/C-S-H co existing with an inactive filler material exerted by unreacted particles. The optimal binder with RSM methodology reached in a high compressive strength of 49.78 +/- 0.30 MPa at 26 days of curing, which obviously confirmed in terms of the microstructural features. A thermal curing (50C degrees) looks effective to maintain a suitable setting time while achieving excellent mechanical and chemical stability in aggressive environments. In these blends, the UPS chemistry is effective to improve both the mechanical and the durability properties where it acts basically as a barrier (chemical and/or physical) owing to the dual-alkali cations (M-S = 1.32) in the activation solution. This study confirms the promise of using the elaborated UPS-MK based geopolymers as sustainable coating materials, which could substantially promote a cleaner production in the construction sector and phosphate mines.

Nevertheless, the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical setting of the area is understudied. In order to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies a profound understanding of the region's groundwater system is essential. In terms of comprehensive field surveys, aquifer structure and properties as well as water composition were evaluated. The Lower Cambrian Limestone and Dolomite Series as well as the Quaternary sediments were identified to be the major aquifer systems. Isotopic signatures of groundwater indicate direct groundwater recharge trough fractures and a major flow direction similar to the drainage system of the Tata River. Hydrochemical composition mainly reflects the mineralogy. The primary processes are calcite and bassanite dissolution as well as dedolomitization and feldspar weathering. Water of irrigation return flow drains downstream and is pumped repeatedly, with each cycle contributing to contamination and water loss through evaporation, while the water is used for irrigation and daily needs. In turn, groundwater quality decreases along its flow path from N to S.

Nevertheless, a moderate groundwater quality was already outlined. In order to understand the possible extent of groundwater pollution and to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies, a groundwater vulnerably assessment was required. In this context the overlay index model DRASTIC (depth of water, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of vadose zone, and hydraulic conductivity) was implemented using specific ratings and weightings for each of the parameters. In the end, areas of greatest potential for groundwater contamination were identified based on geological and hydro geological parameters as well as on human impact (land use). The DRASTIC Index revealed that most of the study site is characterized by a low geological and hydro geological vulnerability. After implementing the land use parameter, a moderate vulnerability was observed, indicating a greater groundwater pollution risk caused by human hazards. Areas of greatest vulnerability occur along agricultural areas and villages. A single-parameter sensitivity analyses resulted in a resealing of the different DRASTIC parameters. Based on this resealing process most of the study site is of high vulnerability. In a second step, hydrochemical groundwater data was used as an actual pollution indicator to verify the vulnerability obtained from DRASTIC.

In this context, the development of highly efficient and low-cost materials for thermal energy storage is imperative for a large use of this technology. The storage of thermal energy using reversible thermo-chemical reactions can provide large storage capacities especially at high temperatures. Within this class of materials, the red-ox reactions have particular interest due to the low cost of the materials involved (metal oxides) and the use of air both as reacting gas and heat transfer fluid. Therefore, many efforts are doing to improve the efficiency and reversibility of this type of reactions. In this work the synthesis and thermal per-formances of a novel mixed metal oxide based on cobalt/nickel metals with spinel structure Co3-xNixO4 is re-ported. A deep study was carried out in order to find the best synthesis conditions and optimum relative metal content in the structure with the objective of decreasing as much as possible the red-ox temperature. The study allowed to determine the optimum Ni content in the oxide structure in order to minimize the reaction tem-perature. In particular, a linear relationship of the red-ox temperature as a function of the Ni content was observed, enabling reaching red-ox temperature below 700 degrees C.

Phosphogypsum and Black Steel Slag as Additives for Ecological Bentonite-Based Materials: Microstructure and Characterization,"['Harrou, A', ' Gharibi, E', ' Taha, Y', ' Fagel, N', ' El Ouahabi, M']","The Black Steel slag (Ss) and phosphogypsum (PG) are industrial wastes produced in Morocco. In order to reduce these two wastes and to evaluate their pozzolanic reactivity in the presence of water, they were incorporated into bentonite (B) mixed with lime (L). The studied mixtures (BLW, BL-PG-W and BL-PG-Ss-W) were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and SEM/EDX analysis. Compressive strength tests were performed on hardened specimens. The results obtained show that the hydration kinetics of the B-L-W and B-L-PG-W mixtures are slow. The addition of PG to a bentonite--lime mixture induces the formation of new microstructures such as hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) and ettringite, which increases the compressive strength of the cementitious specimens. The addition of the Ss to a mixture composed of 8%PG and 8%L-B accelerates the kinetics of hydration and activates the pozzolanic reaction. The presence of C2S in the slag helps to increase the mechanical strength of the mixture B-L-PG-Ss. The compressive strength of the mixtures BL-W, BL-PG-W and BL-PG-Ss-W increases from 15 to 28 days of setting.

Comparative analysis of response surface methodology and some artificial intelligence models in the prediction of methyl green degradation by Fenton process,"['Taoufik, N', ' Boumya, W', ' Achak, M', ' Barka, N']","Dyes rejected by various industries are one of the major hazardous pollutants to be quantified. It is therefore necessary to remove the dye before discharging it into the main water stream. In this study, the catalytic degradation of methyl green (MG) cationic dye by Fenton process 'Fe2+/H2O2' was modelled using four artificial intelligence (AI) models; artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting regressor tree (GBRT) and compared with response surface methodology (RSM). The models were analysed by considering four factors that affect the degradation process: concentration of MG, concentration of Fe2+, concentration of H2O2 and temperature . The objective of this analysis was to quantify the accuracy of prediction of four types of AI models along with RSM model. Sensitivity analyses comprising correlation coefficient, mean square error (MSE) were employed to assess the adequacy of the proposed models. The mean square error (MSE) values corresponding to the validation set for MG degradation were 0.434, 0.232, 0.307, 0.177 and 0.223 while the respective coefficient of determination values were 0.9658, 0.95780 0.9440, 0.9677 and 0.9574 for the ANN, SVM, RF, GBRT and CCD models, respectively. According to these results, the AI and RSM gave a high accuracy in predicting the degradation of the methyl green dye. The four AI models have satisfactory goodness-of-fit, robustness and predictive ability compared to RSM model. The GBRT performs slightly better performance than the other models. Maximum degradation (De% > 98) was achieved at an initial dye concentration of 20 mg/L, a Fe2+ concentration of 7 mM, a hydrogen peroxide dose of 25 mM, and a temperature of 50 degrees C.

Participant characteristics and learning outcomes: Lessons from international food safety capacity building,"['Narrod, C', ' Dou, XY', ' Chfadi, T', ' Miller, M']",The U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) requires monitoring and evaluating (M&E) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food safety capacity building programs.

This paper evaluates the direct impacts of International Good Agricultural Practices trainings delivered to trainers in Latin American countries from 2013 to 2017 and discusses policy implications. The evaluations consisted of in-class knowledge tests and questionnaires. Analyses of tests scores and improvements and participant characteristics show how specific characteristics affected classroom learning outcomes. The evaluation points to the usefulness of objective measurements and toward the need for close collaboration and communication with country partners on training needs and participant recruitment. The findings suggest that candidate screening could be useful to distribute scarce training resources to trainers who benefit better from the program and thereby facilitate food safety capacity building. The evaluation approach used in this paper is the first step of the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's (JIFSAN) Chain of Impacts M&E framework.

Toward Road Safety Recommender Systems: Formal Concepts and Technical Basics,"['Boujemaa, KS', ' Berrada, I', ' Fardousse, K', ' Naggar, O', ' Bourzeix, F']","Worldwide, traffic accidents are recognized as one of the leading causes of death. This phenomenon leads to significant daily losses affecting both road users and road authorities. Therefore, the need for effective dynamic road security systems is highly considered. Traffic accident data analysis is one of the promising approaches for improving road safety. By taking into account multiple factors (e.g., infrastructure, weather, driver behavior, etc.), it allows measuring the impact of traffic accidents on road security. However, reformulating this impact into practical road safety decisions remains limited and unstructured. To overcome the mentioned limitations, this paper proposes the first end-to-end recommendation framework for road safety. Our framework introduces a three-layered architecture, designed to handle data analysis and action recommendation tasks. For data analysis, we adopt a baseline of state-of-the-art machine and deep learning algorithms to build different traffic accident prediction models. For the action recommendation task, we developed a new approach involving model predictions, model interpretations, actions definition, and road-action interactions matrix annotation. The proposed framework has been successfully experimented and evaluated using two real-world datasets of historical traffic accidents of France (2006-2017) and Morocco (2010-2014), achieving interesting ROC-AUC scores of 0.93 and 0.96, respectively.","['Accidents', ' Road safety', ' Predictive models', ' Task analysis', ' Safety', ' Prediction algorithms', ' Data models', ' Traffic accident analysis', ' machine learning', ' deep learning', ' recommendation safety systems', ' traffic accident risk prevention', ' road safety countermeasures', 'TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS', ' NETWORK', ' MODELS']",,IEEE T INTELL TRANSP,"['Engineering', ' Transportation']","['Moroccan Ministry of Equipment', ' Moroccan Foundation of Advanced Science and Innovation']",False,2,False,74
Elaboration of geopolymers based on clays by-products from phosphate mines for construction applications,"['Mabroum, S', ' Aboulayt, A', ' Taha, Y', ' Benzaazoua, M', ' Semlal, N', ' Hakkou, R']","Yellow clays from Moroccan phosphate mines are extracted with other waste rocks lithologies and stored in large dumps within the mine site. The present paper investigates the use of this by-product as a new aluminosilicate source for geopolymers elaboration at the laboratory scale. Yellow clays studied are mainly composed of montmorillonite, dolomite and quartz as major phases. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) showed no existence of contaminant. In order to reach thermal activation, the raw clays were first calcined at different temperatures between 500 and 900 degrees C. Raw and calcined clays were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. For the synthesis of geopolymers, calcined powder was mixed with an alkaline solution presenting different NaOH/Na2SiO3 ratios. The compressive strength was measured at 7, 14 and 28 days and material porosity was determined using Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry method in order to explain the mechanical behavior. XRD, 27Al and 29Si Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transformed infrared and TGA have been used to investigate the gel structure. The thermal treatment at 900 degrees C allowed the destruction of crystalline structure of montmorillonite clays, as well as the formation of new phases such as periclase (MgO) and gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7). Furthermore, the Al-27 - Si-29 MAS-NMR and the XRD analysis of the elaborated materials confirmed the formation of two cementitious gels C-A-S-H (Calcium aluminum silicate hydrate) and N-A-S-H (Sodium aluminum silicate hydrate). The compressive strength was around 25 MPa at 28 days. The obtained results are promising; they have shown that elaborated materials can be adapted for construction applications.

The tale of taro leaf blight: a global effort to safeguard the genetic diversity of taro in the Pacific,"['Alexandra, S', ' Jamora, N', ' Smale, M', ' Ghanem, ME']","This paper examines the vital role of genebanks in the conservation and use of plant genetic resources, highlighting the South Pacific's version of the Irish Potato Famine and the organizational interdependence necessary to respond to disastrous losses in a cultivated food crop. We conducted an ethnobotanical fieldwork in Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Cook Islands, interviewing over 50 taro experts and farmers to gather the 'Tale of Taro Leaf Blight'. Taro is the staple 'prestige' food crop of Samoa but in 1993, taro leaf blight (TLB), Phytophthora colocasiae, caused an almost 100% loss of the crop, threatening both food security and traditional cultural practices. Several international organizations were formed to conduct botanical expeditions to re-gather crop wild relatives of taro, Colocasia esculenta, from their various centres of origin. This parental material was used in a 10-year breeding cycle process to produce viable TLB-resistant varieties and replant the fallow fields of Samoa. The duty to safeguard these global accessions led to the formalization of CePaCT, which houses this core collection. The collection, conservation, multiplication, and distribution of taro has had a significant impact beyond the regional needs of the Pacific. Taro germplasm samples were distributed to countries worldwide affected by the blight, aiding in staving off potential famines and economic crises. This ancient aroid is one of the most consumed vegetables in the Pacific.

The development of a New Process for Phosphate Thickening,"['El Khouakhi, M', ' Mounaam, A', ' Chhiti, Y', ' Bagoun, R', ' El Morabit, A', ' Deshayes, L', ' Sahibed-dine, A']","In phosphate beneficiation process, thickening is used to concentrate the slurry or sludge in order to increase its solid content and recover the maximum of water. The addition of flocculants helps to form larger particles that can thicken out quickly. However, the high consumption of flocculant in the thickeners increases the cost of the operation. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of flocculant on sedimentation velocities of different particles size in order to develop a new thickening process which ensure the maximum thickening rate and a minimum flocculant consumption. To achieve this goal, initially the impact of flocculant on different size fraction was studied. The objective of this step is to define the cut-size from which the flocculant has no considerable effect on thickening. This granulometric slice can decant by a simple free sedimentation without needing the flocculant. After that, a hydrocyclone was dimensioned and modeled in order to eliminate this granulometric slice which will undergo free sedimentation. This allowed to design a new thickening technology that targets only fine particles overflow of the hydro-cyclone and that require the addition of flocculant. This technology will significantly reduce the flocculant consumption and ensure a better water recovery in the thickening process.","['Thickener', ' Hydrocyclone', ' Beneficiation', ' Sedimentation', ' Solid-liquid separation', ' Water recovery', ' Water waste treatment', 'SETTLING VELOCITY', ' SEDIMENTATION', ' MODEL']",2019.0,MOROC J CHEM,['Chemistry'],[''],False,1,False,15

Pseudocapacitive charge storage properties of Na2/3Co2/3Mn2/9Ni1/9O2 in Na-ion batteries,"['Valvo, M', ' Doubaji, S', ' Saadoune, I', ' Edstrom, K']","The behaviour of Na2/3Co2/3Mn2/9Ni1/9O2 in composite electrodes is studied via Na half-cells utilizing a dedicated cyclic voltammetry approach. The application of increasing sweep rates enabled a detailed analysis of the red-ox peaks of this material. All peak currents due to cathodic/anodic processes demonstrated clear capacitive properties. This finding widens the picture of classical Na+ insertion/ extraction in this complex oxide, as purely diffusive processes of Na+ through its layers do not fully explain the pseudocapacitance displayed by its red-ox peaks, which are typically linked to concomitant oxidation state changes for its transition metal atoms and/or phase transitions. No phase transition was observed during in operando X-Ray diffraction upon charge to 4.2 V vs. Na+/Na, proving good structural stability for P2-NaxCo2/3Mn2/9Ni1/9O2 upon Na+ removal. The origin of such pseudocapacitive properties is likely nested in strong electrostatic interactions among the metal oxide slabs and a tendency to release Na+ from its crystallites, e.g. to form surface by-products upon air exposure. Such a reactivity induces defects (e.g. vacancies) in its lattice and charge compensation mechanisms are required to maintain an overall charge neutrality, thus ultimately influencing the electrochemical properties.

Evaluation of the Anthropogenic Metal Pollution at Osisko Lake: Sediments Characterization for Reclamation Purposes,"['Darricau, L', ' Elghali, A', ' Martel, P', ' Benzaazoua, M']","The anthropogenic pollution of lake ecosystems by human activities (e.g., mining industries) is recognized as a serious issue. The Osisko urban lake located in Rouyn-Noranda (Quebec, Canada) was used partially as a waste disposal facility for many decades, causing a heavy pollution. The main undertakings of this study are (i) assessing the mineralogical and geochemical properties of lake Osisko sediments, and (ii) studying the pollution that occurred within lake water due to the sediments' reactivity. Water and sediments across the lake were collected in different sensitive locations. Within the sediment samples, two parts were distinguished: a small layer of black vase over grey sediments. The black vase resembled organic matter while the gray sediment seemed close to clean lake sediments. The collected samples were characterized for their physical (particle size distribution, specific gravity and specific surface area), chemical (minor and major elements as well as total sulfur and carbon) and mineralogical (X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope) properties. Additionally, the reactivity of sediments was studied using weathering cells to quantify chemical species leaching and their releasing rates. The results showed that the vase was the only contaminated part with high concentrations of sulfur and metals such as copper, zinc and iron. Geochemical data showed that the composite sample and the vase potentially cause contaminated acid drainage if they are exposed to atmospheric conditions. Indeed, the pH values of the leachates from both samples were between 4 and 6, while those corresponding to sediments remained around circumneutral values. Quantitatively, the contaminant release from the tested samples was variable. Indeed, the Fe cumulative concentrations were around 200, 80 and 20 mg/kg for the vase, composite and sediment samples, respectively. Similarly, the Zn cumulative concentrations were around 4500, 4200, and below the detection limit for vase, composite and sediment samples, respectively. The same tendency was observed for Cu, S, and Fe. Thus, sediments within Osisko lake present a risk for water contamination if they are resuspended or dredged out of the lake. Consequently, they should be stabilized before their disposal. The samples' high Cu contents also offer the possibility of their reprocessing.","['lake sediments', ' acid mine drainage', ' sulfide oxidation', ' stabilization', ' geochemistry']",2021.0,APPL SCI-BASEL,"['Chemistry', ' Engineering', ' Materials Science', ' Physics']","['NSERC', "" Patrick Martel 'Technosub'""]",False,2,False,54

At the first stage of solar drying (for limed and non-limed sludge), speciation analysis showed that Cr, Pb and Cu are mostly associated to the oxidizable fraction; contrary wise, Ni is mostly associated to the reducible fraction. By the end of the solar drying process, the oxidizable fraction decreased significantly from 80 to 15%, 80 to 25% and from 70 to 27% respectively for Cr, Cu and Pb.

In order to achieve a high polyphenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency and to reduce the number of experiments, two levels of fractional 2(4)factorial design experiments were carried out. The influence of different experimental parameters such as solution pH, adsorbent concentration, contact time, stirring speed, and their interactions during polyphenols and COD removal were investigated. Optimized values of pH, adsorbent concentration, contact time, and stirring speed were found equal to 12, 10 g/L, 24 h, and 420 rpm/min, respectively. The maximum polyphenol uptake under these experimental conditions reached 69.47%. Whereas the maximum removal of COD achieve 43% in 10 g/L, 12, 24 h, and 80 rpm/min for adsorbent concentration, pH, contact time, and stirring speed as optimal conditions, respectively.

Automated Georectification and Mosaicking of UAV-Based Hyperspectral Imagery from Push-Broom Sensors,"['Angel, Y', ' Turner, D', ' Parkes, S', ' Malbeteau, Y', ' Lucieer, A', ' McCabe, ME']","Hyperspectral systems integrated on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provide unique opportunities to conduct high-resolution multitemporal spectral analysis for diverse applications. However, additional time-consuming rectification efforts in postprocessing are routinely required, since geometric distortions can be introduced due to UAV movements during flight, even if navigation/motion sensors are used to track the position of each scan. Part of the challenge in obtaining high-quality imagery relates to the lack of a fast processing workflow that can retrieve geometrically accurate mosaics while optimizing the ground data collection efforts. To address this problem, we explored a computationally robust automated georectification and mosaicking methodology. It operates effectively in a parallel computing environment and evaluates results against a number of high-spatial-resolution datasets (mm to cm resolution) collected using a push-broom sensor and an associated RGB frame-based camera. The methodology estimates the luminance of the hyperspectral swaths and coregisters these against a luminance RGB-based orthophoto. The procedure includes an improved coregistration strategy by integrating the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm, with the Maximum Likelihood Estimator Sample Consensus (MLESAC) approach. SURF identifies common features between each swath and the RGB-orthomosaic, while MLESAC fits the best geometric transformation model to the retrieved matches.

A direct numerical simulation study of skewed three-dimensional spatially evolving compressible mixing layer,"['Boukharfane, R', ' Er-raiy, A', ' Elkarii, M', ' Parsani, M']","The turbulent flow of spatially developing and high-speed hydrogen/air mixing layers subject to small skew angle zeta is systematically investigated by means of direct numerical simulation. The present database features both detailed chemistry and detailed transport (i.e., Soret, Dufour, and bulk viscosity effects). The angle zeta measures the misalignment of the two asymptotic streams of fluid, whose interaction creates the turbulent mixing region. Numerical simulations have been carried out either in the absence of skewing, namely, perfectly parallel streams ( zeta = 0 & DEG;), or in skew angles zeta = 5 & DEG; , 10 & DEG;, and 15 & DEG;. The streamwise evolution and the self-similar state of turbulence statistics of skewed cases are reported and compared to the unskewed and reference case. The present computations indicate that the transitional region and the fully developed turbulence region depends strongly on the degree of flow skewing at the inlet. In particular, we find that skewing yields faster growth of the inlet structures, thus leading to mixing enhancement. The underlying mechanisms responsible for turbulence modulation are analyzed through the transport equation of the Reynolds stresses. One possible perspective of the present work concerns the mixing control and a reliable comparison between the experiment, simulations, and turbulence modeling.</p>","['TURBULENCE STRUCTURE', ' VELOCITY-FIELD', ' GROWTH-RATES', ' SHEAR LAYERS', ' COMBUSTION', ' FLOW', ' JET']",2021.0,PHYS FLUIDS,"['Mechanics', ' Physics']","['ASCC', 'KAUST']",False,2,False,54
Soil pH effects on phosphorus mobilization in the rhizosphere of Lupinus angustifolius,"['Bouray, M', ' Moir, JL', ' Lehto, NJ', ' Condron, LM', ' Touhami, D', ' Hummel, C']","Purpose Increasing the pH of acid soils is a well-recognized means of improving their fertility; however, the effects that plants impose on rhizosphere soils in response to this change are not well understood. This research sought to investigate changes in phosphorus (P) availability in the rhizosphere of blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) in response to an increase in pH. Methods Blue lupin plants were grown in rhizoboxes using two contrasting acid soils at their native pH (5.3 and 4.7) and treated with lime to increase their pH to 6.3 in a replicated trial. Measurements of localized acid phosphomonoesterase activity and P flux were made next to lateral root segments using a combination of zymography and diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT). Rhizosphere and bulk soils were tested for pH, organic anions, exchangeable aluminium (Al), labile P and phosphomonoesterase activity. Root morphological traits, root and shoot yields and shoot nutrient concentrations were also recorded. Results Profiles of DGT-P fluxes across lateral roots showed mobilization of P in the soil with the higher organic P content, and depletion in the other. The extent of acid phosphomonoesterase activity in the rhizosphere decreased with soil pH increase. Shoot P uptake was strongly correlated with fine root length and total organic anions in the rhizosphere. The proportion of thin roots decreased at pH 6.3 compared to the native pH, whereas that of thick roots increased. Conclusion Soil pH increase to 6.3 using lime negatively affects the P acquisition by blue lupin due to the reduction of organic anion exudation, fine root length and the extent of acid phosphomonoesterase activity in the rhizosphere.","['Zymography', ' Diffusive gradient in thin films', ' Fine root', ' Organic anions', ' Blue lupin', ' Phosphorus uptake', 'LIME-INDUCED CHANGES', ' DIFFUSIVE GRADIENTS', ' ROOT MORPHOLOGY', ' CARBOXYLATE EXUDATION', ' LABILE PHOSPHORUS', ' ENZYME-ACTIVITIES', ' PHOSPHATE', ' ALUMINUM', ' AVAILABILITY', ' ACQUISITION']",2021.0,PLANT SOIL,"['Agriculture', ' Plant Sciences']","['VI', 'OCP', 'LU']",True,3,True,98

In addition to high levels of insolation, climate and environmental conditions have a great impact on the efficiency of these technologies. Soiling stands as a major parameter influencing the degradation of transmittance and reflectance for PV glass and CSP reflectors respectively, which decreases electrical performance. In this paper, the PV system and TraCS system (Tracking Cleanliness System) are used to evaluate the soiling effect in two sites with different climate conditions. Environmental variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation, are used as inputs to model soiling. The relationship between different input and output variables are analysed using two linear regression models in a simple form, and with the interaction between model predictors. An in-depth analysis is performed with an artificial neural network (ANN) model, to assess its ability to resolve the complexity of the soiling problem in relation to environmental parameters, and also for comparison with the linear models. The results show that in the region with relatively low rainfall soiling is significantly high and the soiling loss reach up in the summer season -1.07%/day. However, in the region with significant rainy days, the soiling loss is in the range of -0.18%/day in the same period of the year.

Surface modification of MCC was successfully achieved by simple chemical oxidation followed by citric acid esterification and amidation reactions. The resultant nanocrystals were fully characterized for their chemical structure, morphology, crystalline structure, thermal stability, and surface hydrophobicity. FTIR analysis revealed that the long chain hydrocarbon structure was successfully grafted onto CNC surfaces. The crystallinity index of the cellulosic materials calculated by the Segal equation from the corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was relatively reduced from 83.27% for microcrystalline cellulose to 71.12% for organophilic cellulose nanocrystals (CNC-ODA). Moreover, CNC-ODA showed improved thermal stability than unmodified MCC as elucidated by TGA. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed significant change in the size and shape of the produced nanocrystals. The effectiveness of ODA grafting was evidenced by the enhanced hydrophobicity and the long-term stability of the colloidal suspension of organophilic cellulose nanocrystals in various organic solvents which enables this material to be used as highly hydrophobic coating and reinforcing agent for solvent-borne nanocomposites systems.

Missing data techniques in classification for cardiovascular dysautonomias diagnosis,"['Idri, A', ' Kadi, I', ' Abnane, I', ' Fernandez-Aleman, JL']","Missing data (MD) is a common and inevitable problem facing data mining (DM)-based decision systems in e-health since many medical historical datasets contain a huge number of missing values. Therefore, a pre-processing stage is usually required to deal with missing values before building any DM-based decision system. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of MD techniques on classification systems in cardiovascular dysautonomias diagnosis. We analyzed and compared the accuracy rates of four classification techniques: random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), C4.5 decision tree, and Naive Bayes (NB), using two MD techniques: deletion or imputation with k-nearest neighbors (KNN). A total of 216 experiments were therefore carried out using three missingness mechanisms (MCAR: missing completely at random, MAR: missing at random and NMAR: not missing at random), two MD techniques (deletion and KNN imputation), nine MD percentages from 10 to 90% over a dataset collected from the autonomic nervous system (ANS) unit of the University Hospital Avicenne in Morocco. The results obtained suggest that using KNN imputation rather than deletion enhances the accuracy rates of the four classifiers. Moreover, the MD percentages have a negative impact on the performance of classification techniques regardless of the MD mechanisms and MD techniques used. In fact, the accuracy rates of the four classifiers decrease as the MD percentage increases.","['Missing data', ' KNN imputation', ' Missingness mechanism', ' Cardiology', 'MULTIPLE IMPUTATION', ' KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY']",2020.0,MED BIOL ENG COMPUT,"['Computer Science', ' Engineering', ' Mathematical & Computational Biology', ' Medical Informatics']","['TIN', 'FEDER']",False,2,False,50

Although SWR may cause a significant increase in surface runoff, especially in post-summer rainfall events, whether it contributes to background phosphorus losses remains unclear. Surface runoff and P concentrations in runoff were measured on hilly Allophanic pastoral soils with different water repellency levels using seven runoff collectors. Phosphorus fertilizer was broadcasted at 18 kg P ha(-1) in the summer over dry soils. Runoff volumes and P concentrations were measured after each natural rain event prompting surface runoff. The highest runoff/rainfall ratios were observed at the early rainfall events following the dry summer and then decreased significantly by the end of autumn and winter. The post-summer surface runoff correlation with SWR had an R-2 of 0.46, and hydrophobic soils had significantly higher runoff ratios than wettable soils. Measurements of the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and total phosphorus (TP) in the surface runoff showed decreasing exponential trends, with the highest values recorded in the first runoff event following P fertilizer application, where over 90% of losses occurred (incidental losses). After the incidental loss phase, DRP concentrations were related to surface runoff ratio, soil P extractability by water, and SWR. Our data point to non-incidental TP loads being related to SWR (R-2 = 0.53).

The Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope methods were used to estimate SPI trends, and the Pearson correlation between NDVI and SPI was calculated to assess the sensitivity of vegetation types to drought. Results demonstrated that SPI experienced an overall downward trend in the Chichaoua-Mejjate basin, except for SPI3 in summer. The vegetation activity is largely controlled by the drought with clear differences between seasons and time scales at which drought is assessed. Positive correlations between the NDVI and SPI are dominant across the entire study area except in June when almost half of correlations is negative. More than 80% of the study domains exhibit a correlation exceeding 0.4 for SPI3 and SPI6 in March.

A historical set of five landraces and 26 durum wheat cultivars were field cultivated in a humid climate in Eastern Canada, under phosphorus-limiting conditions. To characterize the community of AMF inhabiting bulk soil, rhizosphere, and roots, MiSeq amplicon sequencing targeting the 18S rRNA gene (SSU) was performed on total DNAs using a nested PCR approach.

High Throughput Wireless Links for Time-Sensitive WSNs With Reliable Data Requirements,"['Al-Dweik, A', ' Iraqi, Y']","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and internet of things (IoT) are expected to add a massive number of wireless devices to support various emerging applications. Consequently, adopting high throughput communications protocols is indispensable to serve such a massive number of devices. Therefore, this work presents a new framework, denoted as non-orthogonal multiplexing (NOM), that can substantially improve the throughput of wireless communications links for WSNs applications. The proposed framework utilizes power domain (PD) multiplexing to improve the throughput by recognizing that the hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) protocol and Chase combining (CC) create nonuniform power requirements for the transmitted packets. Consequently, multiple data packets can be combined and transmitted simultaneously using PD multiplexing. More specifically, the proposed framework allows combining multiple new packets, or new and retransmitted packets to increase the system throughput and reduce the delay. Moreover, to overcome channel state information (CSI) feedback limitations, a simple protocol is proposed where the number of transmitted packets is fixed for all transmission sessions. Therefore, the sensing nodes do not need to identify the number of transmitted packets for each transmission slot. The obtained results show that the proposed NOM protocol can eventually improve the link throughput by 100% at high signal to noise ratios (SNRs), and hence, reduce the delay by 50%. The system complexity and overhead are generally comparable to conventional HARQ systems, which confirms the efficiency of the proposed framework.","['NOMA', ' Throughput', ' Sensors', ' Multiplexing', ' Wireless sensor networks', ' Protocols', ' Forward error correction', ' Automatic repeat request (ARQ)', ' hybrid-ARQ (HARQ)', ' non-orthogonal multiplexing (NOM)', ' throughput', ' non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)', 'NONORTHOGONAL MULTIPLE-ACCESS', ' NOMA', ' ARQ', ' OPTIMIZATION', ' SYSTEMS', ' UAVS', ' QAM']",2021.0,IEEE SENS J,"['Engineering', ' Instruments & Instrumentation', ' Physics']",['CIRA'],False,1,False,31
Experimental Study of Fouling in Hybrid Cooling Tower Used in CSP Plants: Effects of the Polymer and galvanized steel tubes,"['Zaza, A', ' Bennouna, EG', ' Laadel, NE', ' El Hammami, Y']","Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants require cooling systems, which are typically operated using either water resources that are scarce in arid regions or dry cooling which impacts the overall efficiency of the system. To ensure a higher sustainability of solar-electric facilities, hybrid cooling is promising solution for higher system efficiency with lower water consumption. However, fouling of cooling components can contribute to several operation issues, such as the reduction of heat transfer, precipitation on heated tubes, and increasing the maintenance cost. It can also be influenced by many parameters, namely the surface proprieties, and operating conditions (such as temperature, water and air flow rates, relative humidity....). To assess the fouling process in the hybrid cooling system, a fouling test facility with a dynamic monitoring system was built its operational performances were experimentally investigated on the basis of a long-term test of 108 days. To explore the influence of the surface materials, the hybrid towers were equipped with polymer and galvanized steel tubes. Based on fouling data, test results indicated that the influence of the tubes positioning on fouling deposition was at least as significant as the influence of tube materials. Generally, the heated tubes at the bottom positions in the test facilities were subject to severe fouling for both tube's materials. As for the polymer heated tubes, an asymptotic fouling resistance value was achieved 22 days before the galvanized ones. Finally, the cleaning method showed that the fouling deposits on polymer tubes were cleaned easily compared with the galvanized tubes.","['Hybrid cooling', ' Fouling resistance', ' Asymptotic fouling', ' CSP plant', ' Heat transfer tube', ' Polymer tube', ' Galvanize steel tube', 'ENHANCED TUBES', ' HEAT-EXCHANGER', ' THERMAL-RESISTANCE', ' WASTE-WATER', ' SYSTEM', ' DESIGN', ' PERFORMANCE', ' CONDENSERS', ' SURFACES', ' ENERGY']",2021.0,THERM SCI ENG PROG,"['Thermodynamics', ' Energy & Fuels', ' Engineering', ' Mechanics']",['European UnionEuropean Commission [654443]'],False,1,False,58

Regenerated membrane was used to study the phosphoric acid clarification at a laboratory scale. They were immersed in an oxidizer for at most seven days. The samples were characterized systematically before immersion in an oxidant media. In this study, the potential to regenerate spent membranes and application of this media to clarify the 29% P2O5 phosphoric acid was demonstrated. This study shows, through experiments, that the reverse osmosis (RO) membranes could achieve a rejection of 70% and 61% for suspended solid and organic matter, respectively.

Effect of Microbial Inoculation on Lipid and Phenols Removal During the Co-composting of Olive Mill Solid Sludge with Green Waste in Bioreactor,"['Bouhia, Y', ' Lyamlouli, K', ' El Fels, L', ' Youssef, Z', ' Ouhdouch, Y', ' Hafidi, M']","In Mediterranean countries, the olive oil industry generates the most important agro-industrial wastewater, which results in the production of a highly toxic sludge following effluent decantation, thus endangering the environment. In this investigation, an optimized composting process via microbial inoculation is suggested as to alleviate the toxicity of olive mill solid sludge (OMS-Sludge) through addressing its high polyphenol and lipid content. The composting assay was carried out in a bioreactor using mixtures of sludge and green wastes, with or without microbial inoculation, namely: E1 (49% sludge + 49% green waste + 2% thermophilic Inoculum), and E2 (50% sludge + 50% green waste). After 4 months of composting the inoculation had affected at significantly (p < 0.05)pH, EC and total organic carbon degradation compared to control. Furthermore, HPLC analysis revealed that OMS-Sludge composting significantly diminished the polyphenol content (95% and 85% for E1 and E2, respectively), and the lipid content (90% and 81% for E1 and E2, respectively). More importantly, microbial inoculation resulted in a significant composting efficiency, which was corroborated by a decomposition rate 65% for E1 compared to 62% for E2. In-planta assays showed that both the lipid and polyphenol contents werestrongly correlated with the sludge phytotoxicity with respect to seed germination, which was demonstrated by a substantial improvement of the germination index of Cabbage (64.44%), Turnip (86.58%) and Cress seeds (120.85%).

Hydrodynamic study of a phosphate flotation cell by CFD approach,"['Hadane, A', ' Khamar, L', ' Benjelloun, S', ' Nounah, A']","The flotation is a widely used separation process. Its efficiency is evaluated essentially through the purification and mass recovery yields. Since this unit operation occurs in liquid medium in the presence of air, the involved interactions are highly influenced by the hydrodynamics flow parameters. Therefore, a rigorous hydrodynamic investigation is required to ensure an optimal performance [1,2]. In this work, the key hydrodynamic parameters that impact the flotation efficiency were investigated. For this purpose, we assimilated the flotation cell to a stirred tank, then we treated two separate cases of hydrodynamic flow using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The first one is the single phase flow and the second is the multiphase flow where we took into consideration phosphate rock (solid particles) suspended in the liquid phase (water). To model and study this kind of complex hydrodynamic flows, we adopted the Eulerian-Eulerian approach, which allowed us to investigate the principal hydrodynamics criteria that can afford optimal operating parameters. These parameters are: the dissipated power, the pumping flow, the number of power, the number of pumping, the mixing time and solid homogenization in the flotation cell fluid sheath. For these performance criteria, the CFD results are in good agreement with those published in experimental studies [3,4].","['Flotation', ' Phosphate', ' Multiphase flow', ' CFD', ' Eulerian-Eulerian', 'REVERSE FLOTATION', ' SURFACE MODIFICATION', ' FLOW', ' SIMULATION', ' PARTICLES', ' COLUMN', ' TANK', ' ELECTROFLOTATION', ' VALIDATION', ' PREDICTION']",2019.0,CHEM ENG PROCESS,"['Energy & Fuels', ' Engineering']",[''],False,1,False,70

The localized MQ-RBFs meshless methods allow to avoid mesh generation and ill-conditioning problem where a sparse matrix is obtained for the global system which has the advantage of using reduced memory and computational time.

"Physicochemical, setting, rheological, and mechanical properties of a novel bio-composite based on apatite cement, bioactive glass, and alginate hydrogel","['Mabroum, H', ' Noukrati, H', ' Ben Youcef, H', ' Lefeuvre, B', ' Oudadesse, H', ' Barroug, A']","Calcium phosphate cements (CPC) have been widely investigated as bone substitutes, owing to their attractive features in terms of physicochemical and biocompatibility properties. However, the clinical applicability of this group of biomaterials is still critically limited by its poor strength and rheological properties in terms of injectability and cohesion. The present work aims to develop novel composite cement based on calcium phosphate cement (CPC) and bioactive glass (BG), associated with sodium alginate hydrogel (Alg). The composition, microstructure, setting, rheological, and mechanical properties of this composite cement were further investigated. Evaluation of setting properties showed that BG participates crucially in the setting reaction as a calcium and phosphate provider and serves as a setting accelerator. Thus, the setting time appears lower in these cements than in the reference CPC cement: it decreases from 75 to 42 min as the BG content increases from 10 to 25 wt% and is delayed from 42 to 73 min while the Alg amount augmented from 1 to 5 wt%. The rheological evaluation revealed that injectability was slightly improved with increasing BG content compared to the injectability of CPC, reaching a value close to 100% when combined with Alg hydrogel. The anti-washout property appeared to be weak for the CPC with or without BG, which are disintegrated in solution. The cohesiveness was significantly improved by introducing Alg hydrogel; furthermore, the addition of 5 wt% of alginate hydrogel induced an increase in the compressive strength about twice (7.2 MPa) higher than that of the reference CPC (4.0 MPa). According to the above findings, the addition of BG acts as a setting accelerator leading to a fast apatite formation, while the introduction of Alg hydrogel as a rheological promoting agent improves the injectability and cohesion. The combination of BG and Alg as additives increased the compressive strength compared to the reference cement.","['Bioactive glass', ' Calcium phosphate cement', ' Composite', ' Compressive strength', ' Injectability', ' Alginate', 'CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE CEMENT', ' DRUG-DELIVERY', ' INJECTABILITY', ' BIOMATERIALS', ' RELEASE', ' PASTES', ' SIZE']",2021.0,CERAM INT,['Materials Science'],['OCP'],True,1,False,52
Effects of surface heterogeneities on wetting and contact line dynamics as observed with the captive bubble technique,"['Guo, ZM', ' Hakkou, R', ' Yang, JG', ' Wang, YL']","Understanding the effects of surface heterogeneities on wetting characteristics and contact line dynamics is significant for a number of applications. In this work, the advancing and receding contact angles on well-defined heterogeneous surfaces were measured using the captive bubble technique. Furthermore, contact line distortions were observed to clarify the origin of the changes in the contact angle. For heterogeneous surfaces with different hydrophilic area fractions but the same hydrophilic defect diameter, the defects had no restrictive effect on the retreating behavior of the contact line, resulting in a nearly constant advancing contact angle. Conversely, during receding contact angle measurements, the presence of a few hydrophilic defects caused three-phase contact line pinning. Increasing the number of hydrophilic defects led to more corrugations of the three-phase contact line, resulting in a decrease in the receding contact angle. For heterogeneous surfaces with the same hydrophilic area fraction but different hydrophilic defect diameters, the advancing contact angles were also nearly constant because in the hydrophilic region, no energy barrier prevented contact line movement. However, the greater energy barriers caused by larger hydrophilic defects led to a slight decrease in the receding contact angles. A comparison of the measured and calculated values for both the advancing and receding contact angles showed that the experimental contact angle results were consistent with the contact angles calculated using the line-fraction Cassie equation. These insights into the wetting behavior of heterogeneous surfaces under liquids are expected to lead to advanced practical applications of heterogeneous surfaces.","['Wetting', ' Heterogeneous surface', ' Captive bubble technique', ' Contact line dynamics', ' Line-fraction Cassie equation']",2021.0,COLLOID SURFACE A,['Chemistry'],['CUMT'],False,1,False,44
Plant Species Rather than Elevated Atmospheric CO2 Impact Rhizosphere Properties and Phosphorus Fractions in a Phosphorus-Deficient Soil,"['Touhami, D', ' Condron, LM', ' McDowell, RW']","By 2050, elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) could stimulate plant growth, but dwindling phosphorus (P) stocks in the soil could limit growth. However, little is known about how eCO(2) could affect soil P availability and dynamics in P-poor soils. Here, we conducted a 6-week pot experiment where three plant species were grown in a low-P soil under ambient (390 ppm) and eCO(2) (700 ppm) to investigate plant growth, rhizosphere properties, and changes in soil P fractions. Our results showed that under P deficiency, plant biomass, P uptake, and rhizosphere properties did not respond to eCO(2). Changes were noted by plant species. Compared to the control soil (unplanted pots), rhizosphere pH decreased the most under wheat, while microbial biomass P was higher under blue lupin. Among plant species, the blue lupin rhizosphere exhibited higher acid and alkaline phosphatase activity as well as organic anion release. Soil P fractions were impacted by plant species but similar across CO2 treatments. Blue lupin accumulated labile organic P while depleted moderately labile organic P. Accumulation of labile organic P could be ascribed to microbial P immobilisation, whereas the mineralization of moderately labile organic P was associated with higher phosphatase activity. Wheat depleted acid extractable inorganic P the most, probably due to soil acidification and higher root biomass. These results suggest that plants can mobilise different P fractions irrespective of their chemical availability using morphological and/or physiological adaptations. However, these adaptations to acquire P from a low-P soil were not affected by eCO(2). This implies that current P fertiliser recommendations to boost or maintain crop production in low-P soils would remain unchanged under future eCO(2).","['Phosphorus deficiency', ' Elevated CO2', ' Climate change', ' Phosphorus fractions', ' Phosphatase activity', ' Organic anion release', 'MICROBIAL BIOMASS PHOSPHORUS', ' ROOT ACID-PHOSPHATASE', ' CARBON-DIOXIDE', ' CARBOXYLATE EXUDATION', ' CHEMICAL NATURE', ' PROTEOID ROOTS', ' CLIMATE-CHANGE', ' ORGANIC-ACIDS', ' LUPIN', ' AVAILABILITY']",2021.0,J SOIL SCI PLANT NUT,"['Plant Sciences', ' Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Agriculture']","['VI', 'OCP', 'CX']",True,3,True,148
Guidelines for a phytomanagement plan by the phytostabilization of mining wastes,"['Zine, H', ' Midhat, L', ' Hakkou, R', ' El Adnani, M', ' Ouhammou, A']","Mine wastes can result in severe pollution and have unaesthetic impacts on the local environment and negative repercussions on human health. Currently, phytomanagement plans provide a cost-effective and sustainable solution for stabilizing these wastes. This approach remains challenging due to uncertainties about plant species selection, their management, the inimical characteristics of metalliferous, low nutrient status, and poor soil physical structure. Therefore, we are proposing guidelines for the phytomanagement of mine wastes. It is a new concept, still very rarely used especially in Morocco. This review is divided into two mains sections: the first section is a non-exhaustive literature review of the available stabilization methods. The second is a detailed methodology in order to successfully implement a phytomanagement plan for mining waste storage facilities. The methodology entails performing an overall screening of the local flora, followed by an appropriate flora selection according to botanical criteria. The second selection is done according to the availability of the genetic material (seeds) in the field and their germination performance. Field trials are crucial to finalize the promising plant list. Eventually, the valorization of produced biomass should be identified according to the concentration of heavy metals in different parts of the selected plants. The performance criteria of these plants were determined, so that corrective action may be taken if necessary. Through this review, we conducted a detailed analysis of this approach and demonstrated its usefulness and benefits over the long term. We showed that the floristic study is a crucial step to select suitable plants for the phytomanagement plan of the mining wastes.

Non-intrusive polynomial chaos methods for uncertainty quantification in wave problems at high frequencies,"['El Mocayd, N', ' Mohamed, MS', ' Seaid, M']","Numerical solutions of wave problems are often influenced by uncertainties generated by a lack of knowledge of the input values related to the domain data and/or boundary conditions in the mathematical equations used in the modeling. Conventional methods for uncertainty quantification in modeling waves constitute severe chal-lenges due to the high computational costs especially at high frequencies/wavenumbers. For a given accuracy and a high wavenumber it is necessary to perform a mesh convergence study by refining the discretization of the computational domain with an increased resolution, which leads to increasing the number of degrees of freedom at a much higher rate than the wavenumber. This effect also known as the pollution error often limits the computations to relatively small values of the wavenumber. To estimate the uncertainties, many model evaluations are required, but only a single surrogate model is created in the process. In the present work, we propose the use of a non-intrusive spectral projection applied to a finite element framework with enriched basis functions for the uncertainty quantification of waves at high frequencies. The method integrates (i) the partition of unity finite element method for effectively computing the solutions of waves at high frequencies; and (ii) a non-intrusive spectral projection for effectively propagating random wavenumbers that encode uncertainties in the wave problems. Compared to the conventional finite element methods, the proposed method is demonstrated to reduce the total cost of accurately computing uncertainties in waves with high values of the wavenumber. Numerical results are presented for two sets of numerical tests. First, the interference of plane waves in a squared domain and then a wave scattering by a circular cylinder are studied at high wavenumbers.

Do guide dogs have culture?

In this essay, we show that unrecognised cultural phenomena are sustained by a special form of indirect social learning (ISL). ISL occurs when an individual B learns a behaviour from an individual A through something produced by A. A's behavioural products can be chemicals, artefacts, but also, we argue, behaviours of another group or species that are the consequence of A's actions. For instance, a behaviour-guiding a blind person-can be transmitted from dog A to dog B, because the fact that dog A learns the behaviour creates in the mind of the trainer representations about the efficacy of the training practice that can be transmitted to another human, who can then train dog B. These dog behaviours have all the properties of standard cultural behaviours and spread in some dog populations through the exploitation of the social learning capacities of another group/species. Following this idea requires a change in perspective on how we see the social transmission of behaviours and brings forward the fact that certain cultural practices can spread among animals through a cultural co-evolutionary dynamic with humans or other animals.","['REARED WOLVES', ' TOOL USE', ' HUMANS', ' TRANSMISSION', ' EVOLUTION', ' IMITATION', ' BEHAVIOR', ' ANIMALS', ' COMMUNICATION', ' COMPREHENSION']",2020.0,HUM SOC SCI COMMUN,"['Arts & Humanities - Other Topics', ' Social Sciences - Other Topics']",[''],False,1,False,86

Geophysical data revealing the control of geological structures in the El Gouna springs in Souss river valley in Morocco,"['Hssaisoune, M', ' Boutaleb, S', ' Tagma, T', ' Benssaou, M', ' Beraaouz, M', ' Karaoui, I', ' Bouchaou, L']","Groundwater, in the Souss-Massa Basin (South western Morocco), occurred under unconfined conditions in the Pliocene and Quaternary formations of the plain, often overlying one or several confined sub-aquifers, such as Neogene and Turonian deep aquifer. The ensemble constituted the multi-layer aquifer system of Souss-Massa Basin. The El Gouna springs emergence, flowing from the Turonian deep aquifer, was one of the natural outlets of the system, with a low flow rate in the downstream part. This study focused on the El Gouna springs area and aimed to understand its hydrogeological functioning based on geological structures and their role in the appearance/disappearance of springs in this area, then studied the relationship between deep and shallow aquifers. For this reason, vertical electrical soundings (VES) using the Schlumberger array and seismic sections using were carried out in the study area. All geophysical data were calibrated by mechanical well logging and geological outcrops, and used to build geoelectrical and seismic cross-sections and structural map. The geoelectrical results showed the alternance of conductive and resistive zones related to the PlioQuaternary deposits. This alternance followed by a conductor layer (<30 Omega m) related to the Senonian marl and marly limestones. The deep resistant layer corresponded to the Cenomano-Turonian limestone aquifer (170 Omega m) with a thickness of about 95 m. Seismic sections showed that the fault pattern in the studied area was mainly concentrated along corridors with a major direction of ENE-WSW and secondary direction of NNE-SSW. The first one constituted an extension of regional faults such as the El Klea and Agadir faults. The highlighted structures bringing the two aquifers into contact, allowing the emergence of some springs in the area. These resurgences came from the Turonian limestone and dolomite deep aquifer. Despite deepening of the impermeable covering deposits (Senonian marls), the water was forced to flow along higher permeability paths of the fault zone.

Accurate state of charge assessment of lithium-manganese dioxide primary batteries,"['Manane, Y', ' Yazami, R']","A new method for state of charge (SOC) assessment of Li/MnO2 primary batteries is disclosed. The method is based on thermodynamics data measurements and processing. Entropy 'Delta S' and enthalpy 'Delta H' data are collected during intermittent discharge process and tentatively linked to SOC. Using Li/MnO2 cell sets from two different manufacturers, we found a linear relationship between SOC, Delta S and Delta H; i.e. SOC = alpha+beta Delta S+lambda Delta H. In the equation alpha, beta and lambda coefficients are manufacturer dependent. This result has been assigned to the physical chemical characteristics MnO2, which vary according the cathode material synthesis conditions specific to each manufacturer. The SOC assessment method was initially developed by us for rechargeable lithium ion battery systems. It surprisingly applies to primary batteries too despite cathode processes are irreversible in nature. It is suggested the method may extend to online SOC assessment owing to an imbedded chip, which collects and processes voltage and temperature data to convert them into thermodynamics data. The method can also be used to characterize MnO2 materials from the thermodynamics properties perspective and to trace Li/MnO2 cell manufacturer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Does wet seeding combined with Sub1 varieties increase yield in submergence prone lowlands of West Africa?,"['Devkota, KP', ' Futakuchi, K', ' Mel, VC', ' Humphreys, E']","Early season flash flooding and submergence greatly impair rice production in the rainfed lowlands of West Africa. Here, rice establishment is by transplanting into puddled soil. Crops established during the early part of the rainy season are adversely affected by submergence, while delaying transplanting until the flood waters have receded results in the use of old seedlings and terminal drought stress. While the use of submergence tolerant (Sub1) rice varieties can greatly reduce the yield loss caused by 1-2 weeks of early season submergence, changing to wet seeding at the start of the rainy season may confer additional advantages. Elsewhere, wet seeding has been shown to enable more timely (earlier) crop establishment and more rapid early growth, and thus the potential to provide greater resilience to submergence. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the performance of two Sub1 varieties developed for West Africa (FARO 66, FARO 67) under transplanted and wet seeded conditions, in comparison with the predominant local variety (WITA 9). On-station experiments were carried-out over three seasons (dry 2018, wet 2019, dry 2019) at Mbe Research Station of the Africa Rice Center, Bouake, Cote d'Ivoire. The fields were submerged for 1-2 weeks at 5-7 weeks after seeding, and the wet season crop was sown at the beginning of the rainy season. Yield of the Sub1 varieties was 1.1-4.5 t ha(-1) higher than that of WITA 9, depending on season and establishment method. Wet seeding resulted in much higher yields of WITA 9 than transplanting in the wet season, but yield of the Sub1 varieties was not affected by establishment method in any season. However, tiller survival and biomass production of the wet seeded Sub1 crops were less affected by submergence than the transplanted crops. Wet seeding also reduced labour requirement and cost, and increased profitability. Furthermore, establishment of the wet season crop at the beginning of the rainy season would facilitate intensification to two crops per year. Therefore, the adoption of Sub1 varieties, could enable significant progress towards the goal of self-sufficiency in rice production in West Africa. Combining Sub1 with wet seeding would provide further benefits in terms of increased profitability and resilience to flash flooding.","['Flash flood', ' Water management', ' Direct seeded rice', ' Rice self-sufficiency', ' Establishment method', 'RICE PRODUCTION', ' IRRIGATED RICE', ' WEED-CONTROL', ' TOLERANCE', ' MANAGEMENT', ' PRODUCTIVITY', ' CULTIVARS', ' SYSTEMS']",2022.0,FIELD CROP RES,['Agriculture'],"['Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR [2000001206]', 'IFAD', 'CGIAR']",False,3,False,59

A Conservative and Monotone Characteristic Finite Element Solver for Three-Dimensional Transport and Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations on Unstructured Grids,"['Khouya, B', ' El-Amrani, M', ' Seaid, M']","We propose a mass-conservative and monotonicity-preserving characteristic finite element method for solving three-dimensional transport and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The main idea in the proposed algorithm consists of combining a mass-conservative and monotonicity-preserving modified method of characteristics for the time integration with a mixed finite element method for the space discretization. This class of computational solvers benefits from the geometrical flexibility of the finite elements and the strong stability of the modified method of characteristics to accurately solve convection-dominated flows using time steps larger than its Eulerian counterparts. In the current study, we implement three-dimensional limiters to convert the proposed solver to a fully mass-conservative and essentially monotonicity-preserving method in addition of a low computational cost. The key idea lies on using quadratic and linear basis functions of the mesh element where the departure point is localized in the interpolation procedures. The proposed method is applied to well-established problems for transport and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three space dimensions.

"The Syenite-Carbonatite Complex of Ihouhaouene (Western Hoggar, Algeria): Interplay Between Alkaline Magma Differentiation and Hybridization of Cumulus Crystal Mushes","['Djeddi, A', ' Parat, F', ' Bodinier, JL', ' Ouzegane, K', ' Dautria, JM']","The 2 Ga-old Ihouhaouene alkaline complex (Western Hoggar, Algeria) is among the oldest known carbonatite occurrences on Earth. The carbonatites are calciocarbonatites hosted by syenites, the predominant rock type in the complex. Both rock types are characterized by medium-grained to pegmatitic textures and contain clinopyroxene, apatite, and wollastonite, associated with K-feldspar in syenites and a groundmass of calcite in carbonatites. The rock suite shows a continuous range of compositions from 57-65 wt.% SiO2 and 0.1-0.4 wt.% CO2 in red syenites to 52-58 wt.% SiO2 and 0.1-6.5 wt.% CO2 in white syenites, 20-35 wt.% SiO2 and 11-24 wt.% CO2 in Si-rich carbonatites (>10% silicate minerals), and <20 wt.% SiO2 and 24-36 wt.% CO2 in Si-poor carbonatites (<5% silicate minerals). Calculation of mineral equilibrium melts reveals that apatite and clinopyroxene are in disequilibrium with each other and were most likely crystallized from different parental magmas before being assembled in the studied rocks. They are subtle in the red syenites, whereas the white syenites and the Si-rich carbonatites bear evidence for parental magmas of highly contrasted compositions. Apatite was equilibrated with LREE-enriched (Ce/Lu = 1,690-6,182) carbonate melts, also characterized by elevated Nb/Ta ratio (>50), whereas clinopyroxene was precipitated from silicate liquids characterized by lower LREE/HREE (Ce/Lu = 49-234) and variable Nb/Ta ratios (Nb/Ta = 2-30). The Si-poor carbonatites resemble the Si-rich carbonatites and the white syenites with elevated REE contents in apatite equilibrium melts compared to clinopyroxene. However, apatite equilibrium melt in Si-poor carbonatite shows a majority of subchondritic values (Nb/Ta<10) and clinopyroxene has chondritic-to-superchondritic values (Nb/Ta = 15-50). Although paradoxical at first sight, this Nb-Ta signature may simply reflect the segregation of the carbonatite from highly evolved silicate melts characterized by extremely low Nb/Ta values. Altogether, our results suggest an evolutionary scheme whereby slow cooling of a silico-carbonated mantle melt resulted in the segregation of both cumulus minerals and immiscible silicate and carbonate melt fractions, resulting in the overall differentiation of the complex. This process was however counterbalanced by intermingling of partially crystallized melt fractions, which resulted in the formation of hybrid alkaline cumulates composed of disequilibrium cumulus phases and variable proportions of carbonate or K-feldspar.","['carbonatite', ' syenite', ' hybrid mineral aggregates', ' alkaline magma', ' Hoggar', 'LIQUID IMMISCIBILITY', ' TRACE-ELEMENTS', ' SYSTEM CAO-MGO-AL2O3-SIO2-CO2', ' PHASE-RELATIONS', ' GROUP MINERALS', ' RARE-EARTH', ' 3 GPA', ' EVOLUTION', ' MANTLE', ' OUZZAL']",2021.0,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,['Geology'],"['FP', 'PROFAS', 'INSU']",False,3,False,80

Plants were grown in mine tailings mixed with an agricultural soil (1:1), 10% compost, and supplied with two different inorganic amendments - rock phosphate (6%) or lime (3%), and inoculated with the rhizobacterial strains Advenella kashmirensis BKM20 (B1) and Mesorhizobium tamadayense BKM04 (B2). The application of organo-mineral amendments ameliorated tailings characteristics, which fostered plant growth and further enhanced soil fertility and microbial activity. These findings were consistent with the increase of total organic carbon levels, with the higher numbers of heterotrophic and phosphate solubilizing bacteria, and higher dehydrogenase and urease activities, found in these substrates after plant establishment. Plant growth was further boosted by PGPR inoculation, most noticeable by co-inoculation of both strains. Moreover, inoculated plants showed increased activities for several antioxidant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase, and glutathione reductase) which indicate a reinforced anti-oxidant system. The application of agricultural soil, compost and lime associated with the inoculation of a mixture of PGPR proved to enhance the establishment of vegetation cover, thus promoting the stabilization of Kettara mine tailings.

A field experiment was conducted for two growing seasons (2018 and 2019), without amendments and with the minimum of human care. PW and the aboveground and belowground parts of the studied plant species were collected and analyzed for As, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn.

Production of cellulose nanofibrils from alfa fibers and its nanoreinforcement potential in polymer nanocomposites,"['Kassab, Z', ' Boujemaoui, A', ' Ben Youcef, H', ' Hajlane, A', ' Hannache, H', ' El Achaby, M']","Alfa fibers (Stipa Tenacissima) were effectively utilized in this study as a promising cellulose source for isolation of carboxy-functionalized cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) using multiple treatments. Pure cellulose microfibers (CMFs) were firstly extracted by alkali and bleaching treatments. CNFs with an average nanofibrils diameter ranging from 1.4 to 4.6 nm and a crystallinity of 89% were isolated from CMFs by a combination of TEMPO-oxidation and mechanical disintegration processes. The morphology and physico-chemical properties of cellulosic materials were evaluated at different stages of treatments using several characterization techniques. Various CNF loadings (5-15 wt%) were incorporated into PVA polymer to evaluate the nanoreinforcement ability of CNFs and to produce CNF-filled PVA nanocomposite materials. The tensile and optical transmittance properties, as well as the morphological and thermal properties of the as-produced CNF-filled PVA nanocomposite films were investigated. It was found that the tensile modulus and strength of nanocomposites were gradually increased with increasing of CNF loadings, with a maximum increase of 90% and 74% was observed for a PVA nanocomposite containing 15 wt% CNFs, respectively. The optical transmittance was reduced from 91% (at 650 nm) for neat PVA polymer to 88%, 82% and 76% for PVA nanocomposites containing 5, 10 and 15 wt% CNFs, respectively. It was also found that the glass transition temperature was gradually increased from 76 degrees C for neat PVA to 89 degrees C for PVA nanocomposite containing 15 wt%. This study demonstrates the importance of Alfa fibers as annual renewable lignocellulosic material to produce CNFs with good morphology and excellent properties. These newly developed carboxy-functionalized CNFs could be considered as a potential nanofiller candidate for the preparation of nanocomposite materials of high transparency and good mechanical properties.Graphic abstract","['Alfa fibers', ' Cellulose nanofibrils', ' Polymer nanocomposites', ' Mechanical properties', 'TEMPO-MEDIATED OXIDATION', ' MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE', ' MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES', ' POLYVINYL-ALCOHOL', ' PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES', ' SUGARCANE BAGASSE', ' NANOCRYSTALS', ' NANOCELLULOSE', ' FILMS', ' PVA']",2019.0,CELLULOSE,"['Materials Science', ' Polymer Science']","['SSF', 'WWSC', 'OCP']",True,3,False,61
Potassium fractions and availability for chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in Vertisols of north-west Ethiopia,"['Misskire, Y', ' Mamo, T', ' Taddesse, AM', ' Yermiyahu, U']","For a critical appraisal of the supplying power of potassium (K) and to predict bioavailable K, it is necessary to have knowledge on the fractions of K and evaluate soil test methods for plant nutrition. This research aimed to assess the forms of K and select a suitable extractant for chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) nutrition on Vertisols of East Gojjam, north-west Ethiopia. Potassium fractions and bioavailable K extracted by chemical solutions was measured using flame photometry. The mineralogy of Vertisols was assessed by X-ray diffraction. The results showed that the fractions of K were significantly correlated to each other and regression analysis showed that 97.6% of the variability of NH4OAc-K was accounted by the HNO3-K and total K fractions, signifying their existence in dynamic equilibrium. The forms of K were correlated to K uptake by chickpea, suggesting the contribution of the fractions of K to plant nutrition. The high level of K in each form was associated with the illite-smectite clay mineral. The availability of K by ammonium bicarbonate-DTPA was best predicted (R-2 = 0.61, p < 0.05) by chickpea uptake in comparison with Mehlich 3 and NH4OAc (R-2 = 0.48 and 0.47, respectively). The weaker prediction of NH4OAc-K may be due to the presence of high fixing clays. Further research is necessary on a wide variety of soils and crop types to verify this result and select a suitable extractant for crops in local conditions.","['available potassium', ' mineralogy of Vertisols', ' potassium pools', ' potassium uptake', 'CALCAREOUS SOILS', ' NONEXCHANGEABLE POTASSIUM', ' CLAY MINERALOGY', ' EXTRACTION', ' FORMS', ' PHOSPHORUS', ' MEHLICH-3', ' CHLORIDE']",2019.0,S AFR J PLANT SOIL,['Agriculture'],"['IPI', 'IPI']",False,2,False,59

Projected changes in East African climate and its impacts on climatic suitability of maize production areas by the mid-twenty-first century,"['Ojara, MA', ' Lou, YS', ' Ongoma, V', ' Mumo, L', ' Akodi, D', ' Ayugi, B', ' Ogwang, BA']","Maize crop (Zea mays) is one of the staple foods in the East African (EA) region. However, the suitability of its production area is threatened by projected climate change. The Multimodel Ensemble (MME) from eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models was used in this paper to show climate change between the recent past (1970-2000) and the future (2041-2060), i.e., the mid-twenty-first century. The climatic suitability of maize crop production areas is evaluated based on these climate datasets and the current maize crop presence points using Maximum entropy models (MaxEnt). The MME projection showed a slight increase in precipitation under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in certain places and a reduction in most of southern Tanzania. The temperature projection showed that the minimum temperature would increase by 0.3 to 2.95 degrees C and 0.3 to 3.2 degrees C under RCP4.5 and 8.5, respectively. Moreover, the maximum temperature would increase by 1.0 to 3.0 degrees C and 1.2 to 3.6 degrees C under RCP4.5 and 8.5 respectively. The impacts of these projected changes in climate on maize production areas are the reduction in the suitability of the crop, especially around central and western Tanzania, mid-northern and western Uganda, and parts of western Kenya by 20-40%, and patches of EA will experience a reduction of as high as 40-60%, especially in northern Uganda, and western Kenya. The projected changes in temperature and precipitation present a significant negative change in maize crop suitability. Thus, food security and the efforts towards the elimination of hunger in EA by the mid-twenty-first century will be hampered significantly.

Concentrations of inorganic contaminants released from single waste rocks were measured by means of weathering cell, CTEU-9, TCLP and SPLP tests. Compressive strength and immobilization performance of obtained concretes based on these waste rocks were assessed. The results of humidity cell tests indicated that waste rock with higher sulfur content (0.47 wt%) and lower carbon content (0.26 wt%) did not present an acid generating potential according the Quebec environmental regulation. Those of TCLP, SPLP and CTEU-9 batch tests showed a concentration of contaminants in leachate solutions from waste rocks below the standardized limits fixed by the Environmental Protection Agency.

To this end, simulation of four solar power plants configurations -with a nominal capacity of 100 MWe from different technologies (fixed PV, 1 axis tracking PV, 2 axis tracking PV, and Stirling Dish) coupled with a PEM electrolyzer has been done. For the sake of precision, 3 years average of high quality meteorological data measured in-situ and at 5 different locations were used as simulation inputs. To have an idea about the potential of Morocco in the green hydrogen production market, we benchmarked the simulation results against the ones from Almeria, Spain and Stellenbosch, South Africa. Results show that for almost all sites, the 1 axis tracking PV system is the optimal technology -from techno-economic aspect-for green Hydrogen production in Morocco, even though the 2 axis tracking PV systems can generate the highest amounts of hydrogen (similar to 4500 Tons/year), the fixed PV has the lowest LCOH2 (5.8 $/Kg) and the Stirling Dish is the most efficient one (similar to 12%). Besides, Morocco can be considered as a very competitive country for green hydrogen production (especially for PV technology) with an LCOH2 of 5.57 $/Kg, against 5,96$/Kg in Southern Spain and 6,51$/Kg for south Africa.

In this work, two innovative dry fractionation technologies (physical fractionation: turbo-and electrostatic separation of lignocellulose particles) have been developed for rice straw RS fractionation and bioconversion to sugars and biofuels. Turbo-fractionation technology (TF-T) comprises particle separation according to their size and density, whereas electrostatic fractionation technology (EF-T) is based on the separation of particles according to their surface properties (chemical composition and charges). TF-T and EF-T are suitable for producing lignocellulose fractions displaying very different structures, biochemical compositions and reactive surfaces without extensively damaging the raw fibers as well as minimizing waste generation (E-factor: 0.7-0.75).

Dynamics of seasonal snowpack over the High Atlas,"['Tuel, A', ' Chehbouni, A', ' Eltahir, EAB']","Snowpack melting in the High Atlas constitutes the major source of freshwater for the semi-arid agricultural plains of central Morocco. Snow runoff fills dams during spring and recharges groundwater, thus providing the necessary water for irrigation and hydropower production. Despite its critical importance for the region, basic questions about the High Atlas snowpack remain largely unanswered. In particular, the spatial and temporal distribution of snow water equivalent, as well as sublimation losses, potentially significant in this region, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. The scarcity of ground data has been a major obstacle to investigating snow processes in the High Atlas. Here, we demonstrate the potential of remotely-sensed meteorological variables and downscaled climate reanalysis data to gain important insights into snow water balance in a semi-arid region. We apply a distributed energy balance snow model based on SNOW17, constrained by topographic data, meteorological data from satellites and high-resolution dynamically-downscaled ERA-Interim data, to simulate snowpack dynamics within the Oum-Er-Rbia watershed, at the heart of Morocco's High Atlas. The simulations are compared to MODIS snow cover maps and observed snow depth at one field station. Results show that the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of snow cover at various elevation ranges are accurately captured. The snowpack is essentially concentrated above 2500 m, extends over 500-6000 km(2) and holds 0.05-0.4 km(3) at its peak in early February. Additionally, we find that losses by sublimation range from 0.06 to 0.14 km(3) for an average of 0.09 km(3) a year, about 10% of all snowfall. Above 3000 m elevation, sublimation removes on average 20% of the snowpack. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of our results to uncertainties in the forcing meteorological data.

Estimating software development effort using fuzzy clustering-based analogy,"['Amazal, FA', ' Idri, A']","During the past decades, many studies have been carried out in an attempt to build accurate software development effort estimation techniques. However, none of the techniques proposed has proven to be successful at predicting software effort in all circumstances. Among these techniques, analogy-based estimation has gained significant popularity within software engineering community because of its outstanding performance and ability to mimic the human problem solving approach. One of the challenges facing analogy-based effort estimation is how to predict effort when software projects are described by a mixture of continuous and categorical features. To address this issue, the present study proposes an improvement of our former 2FA-kprototypes technique referred to as 2FA-cmeans. 2FA-cmeans uses a clustering technique, called general fuzzy c-means, which is a generalization of the fuzzy c-means clustering technique to cluster objects with mixed attributes. The performance of 2FA-cmeans was evaluated and compared with that of our former 2FA-kprototypes technique as well as classical analogy over six datasets that are quite diverse and have different sizes.

Sensitivity and Interdependency Analysis of the HBV Conceptual Model Parameters in a Semi-Arid Mountainous Watershed,"['Ouatiki, H', ' Boudhar, A', ' Ouhinou, A', ' Beljadid, A', ' Leblanc, M', ' Chehbouni, A']","Hydrological models, with different levels of complexity, have become inherent tools in water resource management. Conceptual models with low input data requirements are preferred for streamflow modeling, particularly in poorly gauged watersheds. However, the inadequacy of model structures in the hydrologic regime of a given watershed can lead to uncertain parameter estimation. Therefore, an understanding of the model parameters' behavior with respect to the dominant hydrologic responses is of high necessity. In this study, we aim to investigate the parameterization of the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavedelning) conceptual model and its influence on the model response in a semi-arid context. To this end, the capability of the model to simulate the daily streamflow was evaluated. Then, sensitivity and interdependency analyses were carried out to identify the most influential model parameters and emphasize how these parameters interact to fit the observed streamflow under contrasted hydroclimatic conditions. The results show that the HBV model can fairly reproduce the observed daily streamflow in the watershed of interest. However, the reliability of the model simulations varies from one year to another. The sensitivity analysis showed that each of the model parameters has a certain degree of influence on model behavior. The temperature correction factor (ETF) showed the lowest effect on the model response, while the sensitivity to the degree-day factor (DDF) highly depends on the availability of snow cover. Overall, the changes in hydroclimatic conditions were found to be mostly responsible for the annual variability of the optimal parameter values. Additionally, these changes seem to actuate the interdependency between the parameters of the soil moisture and the response routines, particularly Field Capacity (FC), the recession coefficient K0, the percolation coefficient (KPERC), and the upper reservoir threshold (UZL). The latter combines either to shrink the storage capacity of the model's reservoirs under extremely high peak flows or to enlarge them under overestimated water supply, mainly provoked by abundant snow cover.","['HBV model', ' conceptual', ' semi-arid', ' mountain', ' sensitivity analysis', ' interdependency analysis', 'RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS', ' SNOW-COVER PRODUCTS', ' SIMULATING STREAMFLOW', ' AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION', ' CLIMATE-CHANGE', ' PERFORMANCE', ' UNCERTAINTY', ' LENGTH', ' BASIN', ' CLASSIFICATION']",2020.0,WATER-SUI,"['Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Water Resources']",['IWRI'],False,1,False,90

A structural equation model (SEM) was adopted to analyze the determinants of ITP according to the theory of planned behavior (TPB) combined with latent psychological variables that describe the personal characteristics and evaluations of different measures. Furthermore, the moderating effects of socioeconomic characteristics were also examined. A sample of 340 car drivers, interviewed at different locations of Peshawar, Pakistan, was used to test the model. Results of the SEM model indicated that Road Infrastructure Safety Perception and Perceived Behavioral Control have strong association with the ITP of car users' for road safety improvement. Risk Perception, Attitude towards Traffic Safety Responsibility, Attitude, Perceived Fairness, and Perceived Effectiveness were also associated with ITP. Differential age and gender-related moderating effects were also observed. Findings from this study are expected to assist the decision-makers in the effective planning and implementation of road safety projects and related budget allocations.","['Road safety', ' Intention-to-pay', ' Developing countries', ' Theory of planned behavior', ' Structural equation modeling', 'WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY', ' PLANNED BEHAVIOR', ' RISK PERCEPTION', ' INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', ' CAR DRIVERS', ' MODEL', ' TRANSPORT', ' ACCEPTABILITY', ' PEDESTRIANS', ' ACCEPTANCE']",2021.0,ACCIDENT ANAL PREV,"['Engineering', ' Public, Environmental & Occupational Health', ' Social Sciences - Other Topics', ' Transportation']",[''],False,1,False,80
"Mapping soil erosion-prone sites through GIS and remote sensing for the Tifnout Askaoun watershed, southern Morocco","['Tairi, A', ' Elmouden, A', ' Bouchaou, L', ' Aboulouafa, M']","The Moroccan High Atlas is very sensitive to soil erosion due to its steep slopes, torrential rains, and degraded plant cover. The degradation of fertile soils in this mountainous watershed influences negatively upon agricultural productivity. The objective of this study is to quantify soil erosion in the Tifnout Askaoun watershed in southern Morocco. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), the geographic information system (GIS) techniques, and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data were adopted for mapping the annual rate of soil loss in this watershed area of around 1488 km(2). The spatial distribution of annual soil erosion rates was obtained by integrating the geo-environmental variables into a GIS. These variables are the rainfall erosivity (R) generated from the TRMM data, the soil erodibility factor (K), the length and slope inclination (LS), the vegetation and management factor (C), and the practice support factor (P). Results reveal an average annual soil erosion rate of 14.44 t/ha/year and a good correlation with the slope length and steepness factor (r = 0.72) and in a lesser extent with the rainfall erosivity factor (r = 0.63). The sub-catchments of the study area were mapped and grouped into five classes of vulnerability to soil erosion risk, with results indicating that the Toubkal sub-catchment is the most threatened by water erosion risk as reflected by an average erosion rate of 48.05 t/ha/year. Approaches and results from this study, which was conducted between 2017 and 2019, may benefit researchers and decision-makers concerned with soil management primarily in mountainous areas where soil degradation impacts the activities of the rural population.","['Soil loss', ' RUSLE', ' GIS', ' Tifnout Askaoun', ' High Atlas Mountains', ' Morocco', 'LOSS EQUATION RUSLE', ' EDIACARAN VOLCANIC-ROCKS', ' RISK-ASSESSMENT', ' ANTI-ATLAS', ' INTEGRATED USE', ' NUWEIBA AREA', ' LAND-USE', ' MODEL', ' GEOCHEMISTRY', ' VEGETATION']",2021.0,ARAB J GEOSCI,['Geology'],['II'],False,1,False,90

The effects of these elements' addition on thermal properties, glass structure, and dissolution behaviors were investigated. Results showed that these glasses are composed essentially of metaphosphate chains and that the addition of micronutrients could change the chemical durability of phosphate glasses. A greenhouse experiment was performed using wheat (Triticum durum L.) to evaluate the efficiency of the four glasses, with or without application of chemical nitrogen (N) (N + VF and VF, respectively). The different formulas were tested using two rates of 0.3 and 1 g per plant. In addition to the vitreous fertilizer formulations, two other treatments were applied: control treatment with no amendment and Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium treatment with the application of the conventional fertilizers on the base of optimal rates. After four months of cultivation, vitreous fertilizers application significantly improved growth (7% to 88%), photosynthetic (8% to 49%) parameters, and yield (29% to 33%) compared to NPK treatment and to the control. It has been found that formulas F-1, F-2, and F-3 may constitute a potential alternative to conventional fertilization due to their positive impact on wheat production and can be used in practice as an environmentally controlled-release fertilizer.","['glass', ' phosphate', ' chemical durability', ' growth', ' yield', ' Triticum durum']",2021.0,MATERIALS,"['Chemistry', ' Materials Science', ' Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering', ' Physics']",['OCP'],True,1,False,55

It is also engaged to highlight a synergic effect of liming (1% CaO) and solar drying on helminth egg reduction. The solar drying process was conducted for 45 days, in summer under a semi-arid climate in a pilot scale polycarbonate-based tunnel (2 m(3)). Before undergoing solar drying process, data showed an important load of helminth eggs including Ascaris sp., Schistosoma spp., Capillaria spp., Trichuris spp., Ankylostome spp., Toxocara spp., and Taenia spp. in limed sludge (LS) and non-limed sludge (NLS) (15.2 and 17.9 eggs/g, respectively). Ascaris eggs were the most abundant (11.2 and 13.5 eggs/g in LS and NLS, respectively). By the end of the solar drying process, a considerable removal of the total helminth eggs was recorded in LS and NLS (92.8% and 91.6%, respectively). A complete removal of Schistosoma spp., Capillaria spp., Trichuris spp., Toxocara spp. and Taenia spp. was noted in LS and NLS. In the case of Ankylostome spp., data showed a total removal in LS and 81% in NLS; however, the final load is in agreement with the standards (0.4 egg/g). As for Ascaris spp., neither liming nor solar drying process allowed a complete removal (91% and 90% in NLS and LS, respectively) and the final load (1.1 egg/g) does not fulfill the WHO requirements for an agricultural use. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated a negative correlation between dry matter (DM) content (hence temperature) and helminth egg concentration.

Here in situ X-ray spectroscopy studies show that the redox behaviour of oxygen anions can account for an increase in specific capacity at high voltages. Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries have recently attracted renewed interest as an alternative to Li-ion batteries for electric energy storage applications, because of the low cost and wide availability of sodium resources. Thus, the electrochemical energy storage community has been devoting increased attention to designing new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Here we investigate P2- Na0.78Co1/2Mn1/3Ni1/6O2 as a cathode material for sodium ion batteries. The main focus is to understand the mechanism of the electrochemical performance of this material, especially differences observed in redox reactions at high potentials.

In this context, experimental, modeling and thermodynamic analysis of adsorption isotherms of four types of agricultural wastes (olive pomace), have been carried out. Two samples were separately de-oiled by the maceration method and the hydrothermal carbonization process. Besides, adsorption isotherms of these biomass samples were obtained experimentally at three oven temperatures (30, 40 and 50 degrees C). The findings showed that the de-oiled samples are more hydrophobic than those containing residual oil, especially when water activity (a(w)) values are higher than 0.4. Moreover, adsorption isotherms were modeled by five mathematical models available in the literature. In the thermodynamic point of view, the net isosteric heat and the differential entropy of adsorption were estimated for each sample. The highest value of the net isosteric heat (around 65 kJ mol(-1)) is obtained for no de-oiled samples. Also, it has been found that the development of monolayer adsorption requires more net isosteric heat to ensure the water molecules adhesion to the biomass surface unlike the formation of multilayer adsorption. In addition, the enthalpy/entropy compensation theory for all examined biomasses was confirmed, and their free energy values are positive (between 3479.8 and 4155.6 J mol(-1)).

In this work, heterogeneous surfaces with different hydrophobic area fractions were prepared. These surfaces consisted of discrete hydrophilic dots and interconnected hydrophobic background. The contact angles between the heterogeneous surface and bubble were measured at different bubble sizes and the pseudo-line tensions were calculated. Meanwhile, a model was developed to estimate the pseudo-line tension on the heterogeneous surface.

Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Assemblages Significantly Shifted upon Bacterial Inoculation in Non-Contaminated and Petroleum-Contaminated Environments,"['Dagher, DJ', ' de la Providencia, IE', ' Pitre, FE', ' St-Arnaud, M', ' Hijri, M']","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to reduce plant stress and improve their health and growth, making them important components of the plant-root associated microbiome, especially in stressful conditions such as petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) contaminated environments. Purposely manipulating the root-associated AMF assemblages in order to improve plant health and modulate their interaction with the rhizosphere microbes could lead to increased agricultural crop yields and phytoremediation performance by the host plant and its root-associated microbiota. In this study, we tested whether repeated inoculations with a Proteobacteria consortium influenced plant productivity and the AMF assemblages associated with the root and rhizosphere of four plant species growing either in non-contaminated natural soil or in sediments contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. A mesocosm experiment was performed in a randomized complete block design in four blocks with two factors: (1) substrate contamination (contaminated or not contaminated), and (2) inoculation (or not) with a bacterial consortium composed of ten isolates of Proteobacteria. Plants were grown in a greenhouse over four months, after which the effect of treatments on plant biomass and petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in the substrate were determined. MiSeq amplicon sequencing, targeting the 18S rRNA gene, was used to assess AMF community structures in the roots and rhizosphere of plants growing in both contaminated and non-contaminated substrates. We also investigated the contribution of plant identity and biotope (plant roots and rhizospheric soil) in shaping the associated AMF assemblages. Our results showed that while inoculation caused a significant shift in AMF communities, the substrate contamination had a much stronger influence on their structure, followed by the biotope and plant identity to a lesser extent. Moreover, inoculation significantly increased plant biomass production and was associated with a decreased petroleum hydrocarbons dissipation in the contaminated soil. The outcome of this study provides knowledge on the factors influencing the diversity and community structure of AMF associated with indigenous plants following repeated inoculation of a bacterial consortium.

The first originality of this article is to suggest a global framework positioning the different types of criteria that may be used, based on an analysis of the relationships between the concept defining the decision making context. For assessing the various decision criteria, an important requirement of the company was to reuse when possible assessments coming from trustable external sources, mainly international organization indexes (World Bank, World Economic Forum, etc.), and to complete them with knowledge coming from internal experts.

Microbiome of Field Grown Hemp Reveals Potential Microbial Interactions With Root and Rhizosphere Soil,"['Ahmed, B', ' Smart, LB', ' Hijri, M']","Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a crop bred and grown for the production of fiber, grain, and floral extracts that contribute to health and wellness. Hemp plants interact with a myriad of microbiota inhabiting the phyllosphere, endosphere, rhizoplane, and rhizosphere. These microbes offer many ecological services, particularly those of below ground biotopes which are involved in nutrient cycling, uptake, and alleviating biotic and abiotic stress. The microbiota communities of the hemp rhizosphere in the field are not well documented. To discover core microbiota associated with field grown hemp, we cultivated single C. sativa cultivar, TJ's CBD, in six different fields in New York and sampled hemp roots and their rhizospheric soil. We used Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing targeting 16S ribosomal DNA of bacteria and ITS of fungi to study microbial community structure of hemp roots and rhizospheres. We found that Planctobacteria and Ascomycota dominated the taxonomic composition of hemp associated microbial community. We identified potential core microbiota in each community (bacteria: eight bacterial amplicon sequence variant - ASV, identified as Gimesia maris, Pirellula sp.

The only hub taxa detected in both the root and rhizosphere soil microbiota was ASV37 (Caulifigura coniformis), a bacterial taxon. The core microbiota and Network hub taxa can be studied further for biocontrol activities and functional investigations in the formulation of hemp bioinoculants.

Design and Analysis of High-Speed Free Space Optical (FSO) Communication System for Supporting Fifth Generation (5G) Data Services in Diverse Geographical Locations of India,"['Singh, H', ' Mittal, N', ' Miglani, R', ' Singh, H', ' Gaba, GS', ' Hedabou, M']","Free space optical (FSO) communication has established a reputation for itself as a next-generation network capable of delivering high-speed data services. In light of the upcoming launch of 5G services, this paper aims to evaluate the performance of the FSO system for the implementation of 5G technology in diverse geographical locations of India. The proposed 16x10 Gbps wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) based FSO link uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and digital signal processing (DSP) module to mitigate channel-induced limitations. Additionally, the proposedFSOdesign also employs Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) with optimized gain characteristics. Using the data sourced from theMeteorological Department of India, the link analysis reveals that due to weak fog events in coastal areas effective link range of up to 10.75 km can be achieved while maintaining bit error rate of 10(-9). Despite dominant foggy conditions in hilly, plains and desert areas, the proposed FSO link significantly limits the degrading effects of channel. Hence, in pursuit of futuristic smart city models, a heterogeneous combination of FSO and 5G infrastructure can conveniently cover diverse geographical locations of India to support high-speed data connectivity.","['Free space optical communication', ' fifth generation networks', ' meteorological effects', ' OFDM', ' WDM', ' digital signal processing', ' bit error rate', 'LINK', ' AVAILABILITY', ' PERFORMANCE', ' WIRELESS', ' CLEAR', ' OFDM']",2021.0,IEEE PHOTONICS J,"['Engineering', ' Optics', ' Physics']",[''],False,1,False,48
A Well-Balanced Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Multilayer Shallow Water Equations with Non-Flat Bottom Topography,"['Izem, N', ' Seaid, M']",A well-balanced Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method is presented for the numerical solution of multilayer shallow water equations with mass exchange and non-flat bottom topography. The governing equations are reformulated as a nonlinear system of conservation laws with differential source forces and reaction terms. Coupling between the flow layers is accounted for in the system using a set of exchange relations. The considered well-balanced Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method is a locally conservative finite element method whose approximate solutions are discontinuous across the inter-element boundaries. The well-balanced property is achieved using a special discretization of source terms that depends on the nature of hydrostatic solutions along with the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre nodes for the quadrature used in the approximation of source terms. The method can also be viewed as a high-order version of upwind finite volume solvers and it offers attractive features for the numerical solution of conservation laws for which standard finite element methods fail. To deal with the source terms we also implement a high-order splitting operator for the time integration. The accuracy of the proposed Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method is examined for several examples of multilayer free-surface flows over both flat and non-flat beds. The performance of the method is also demonstrated by comparing the results obtained using the proposed method to those obtained using the incompressible hydrostatic Navier-Stokes equations and a well-established kinetic method. The proposed method is also applied to solve a recirculation flow problem in the Strait of Gibraltar.,"['Discontinuous Galerkin method', ' well-balanced discretization', ' Runge-Kutta scheme', ' multilayer shallow water equations', ' free-surface flows', ' mass exchange', ' wind-driven flows', ' strait of Gibraltar', 'NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS', ' FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD', ' SAINT-VENANT SYSTEM', ' HYDROSTATIC RECONSTRUCTION', ' CONSERVATION-LAWS', ' WENO SCHEMES', ' ORDER', ' STRAIT', ' FLOWS', ' MODEL']",,ADV APPL MATH MECH,"['Mathematics', ' Mechanics']",['ERC'],False,1,False,49
Primal column generation framework for vehicle and crew scheduling problems,"['Himmich, I', ' El Hallaoui, I', ' Soumis, F']","The primal adjacency-based algorithm and the multidirectional dynamic programming algorithm are two exact methods that have recently been developed to efficiently solve the shortest path problem with resource constraints (SPPRCs). These methods are primal in the sense that they are able to produce sequences of feasible solutions using iterative exploration of the search space. Since the SPPRCs often appear as a subproblem (SP) in the solution of vehicle and crew scheduling problems (VCSP) using column generation (CG), we propose a new primal column generation framework that embeds these primal methods in a CG scheme. The primal column generation solves at each iteration a sequence of appropriate restricted SP and stops solving the SP when there is no need to continue. This approach introduces a large degree of flexibility, and allows performing good cost improvements in a very limited time. Computational experiments on VCSP instances show that the proposed approach is able to find optimal solutions while reducing the time spent solving the SP by factors of up to seven compared to the standard CG algorithm. This leads to significant improvements in the overall solution times, with an average reduction factor of 3.5.","['column generation', ' dynamic programming', ' primal paradigm', ' shortest path problem with resource constraints', ' subproblems', 'SHORTEST-PATH PROBLEM', ' ALGORITHM']",2020.0,NETWORKS,"['Computer Science', ' Operations Research & Management Science']","['Kronos Inc.', 'NSERC']",False,2,False,18
Do metal contamination and plant species affect microbial abundance and bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of metallophytes growing in mining areas in a semiarid climate?,"['Benidire, L', ' Pereira, SIA', ' Naylo, A', ' Castro, PML', ' Boularbah, A']","Purpose Mining areas are low-quality habitats for macro- and microorganisms' development, mainly due to the degradation of the soil quality by metal pollution. The present work aimed to analyze the influence of metal contamination and of plant species on the rhizospheric microbial communities of four indigenous metallophytes (Ononis natrix, Haloxylon scoparium, Peganum harmala, and Aizoon canariense) growing along a metal contamination gradient in Kettara mine near Marrakech, Morocco. Materials and methods In pyrrhotite mining areas (Kettara mine, Morocco), rhizosphere soil samples were collected from four predominant indigenous metallophytes (O. natrix, H. scoparium, P. harmala, and A. canariense) growing along a metal contamination gradient (ZC, control zone; Z1, high metal contamination; Z2, moderate metal contamination; Z3, low metal contamination). Microbial communities were analyzed by using microbial counts and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The physicochemical properties (pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, nitrogen, P Olsen, and metal concentrations) of soils were also determined. Results and discussion The physicochemical analysis revealed that rhizospheric soils from Z1, Z2, and Z3 were relatively poor in nutrients as they presented low levels of total organic carbon and nitrogen, organic matter and available P. Moreover, these rhizospheric soils showed high concentrations of metals, especially Cu and Pb, which significantly reduced the abundance of the different groups of soil microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes) and the activity of soil dehydrogenase. The analysis of bacterial communities by DGGE revealed that bacterial diversity was not negatively affected by metal contamination being higher in the most contaminated area (Z1). Conclusions Overall, the microbial abundance, the composition, and the diversity of rhizospheric bacterial communities were more influenced by the environmental factors in sampling zones than by plant cover. Microbial counts and enzymatic activity were both systematically affected throughout the metal gradient, evidencing as good indicators of the harmful effects of anthropogenic disturbances in soils.

Cellulose nanocrystal deposition onto regenerated cellulose fibres: effect on moisture absorption and fibre-matrix adhesion,"['Hajlane, A', ' Joffe, R', ' Kaddami, H']","The effect of treatment of regenerated cellulose fibres by cellulose nanocrystals on the moisture absorption of the fibres as well as on fibre-epoxy resin adhesion has been investigated. Nanocrystals were deposited on the fibres using gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) as coupling agent. Water absorption tests performed on fibres showed that, at 64% relative humidity, treatment by the coupling agent decreased the water uptake by a factor of two compared with untreated fibres, whereas deposition of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) on fibres treated with MPS (FMMPS) did not further increase the water absorption despite the hydrophilic character of the CNC. This result was confirmed by monitoring fibre swelling using contact angle measurements. Indeed, it was found that FMMPS presented the same contact angle with glycerol before and after CNC deposition, being higher than that obtained for untreated fibres. The tensile strength and stiffness of fibres were not affected by moisture after either treatment, but nanocrystal deposition enhanced the fibre-epoxy resin adhesion, as revealed by results of pull-out tests performed on fibre bundles at 64% relative humidity.","['Cellulose fibres', ' Surface treatment', ' Moisture absorption', ' Cellulose nanocrystals', ' Fibre-matrix interface', 'NATURAL FIBERS', ' HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE', ' MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES', ' SURFACE TREATMENTS', ' COMPOSITES', ' NANOCOMPOSITES', ' REINFORCEMENT']",2018.0,CELLULOSE,"['Materials Science', ' Polymer Science']","['II', ' Moroccan National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research', ' Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2009-6433]', 'EXCEL']",False,4,False,25

Then, it defines a new simplified index WQI(min) based on parameters that are easy to measure in the laboratory or in the field. This simplification of the NSF-WQI parameters is based on principal component analysis, to reduce their associated analytical costs. Compared to NSF-WQI, similar spatiotemporal trends in water quality were obtained by WQI(min) (R-2 = 0.68). The WQI(min) reveals that during spring, autumn and winter (2016-2017) the quality in the Bin El Ouidane is good upstream, whilst it is undergoing a severe degradation into poor and very-poor-quality status in the downstream section, caused by high population rate and its pollution load coming from a polluted shallow aquifer. In summer when the flow discharge is low, the quality in the upper section is poor, whilst in the downstream section (from Bin El Ouidane to the outlet) it is decreasing to very-poor-quality status (WQI(min) = 89.57). In conclusion, the quality status in the downstream section is alarming and needs urgent intervention.

The understanding of structural properties-relationships for C4 olefins separation using solid state materials is still lacking particularly for microporous materials with purely cage-based structures. Herein, the adsorptive separation of C4 olefins (butene isomers and 1,3-butadiene) by the microporous MOF, Y-fum-fcu-MOF, containing octahedral and tetrahedral cages with triangular pore aperture size (?4.7 ?), is studied. The adsorption capacities of the MOF for C4 olefins were assessed by measuring the single component adsorption isotherms at 30 ?C which led to very similar equilibrium adsorption uptakes at saturation for the components (excluding isobutylene). However, adsorption breakthrough curves collected at 25 ?C and Pulse Gas Chromatography experiments, conducted to define the guest?host affinity at very low concentration (Henry?s region), evidenced kinetically driven separation of C4 olefins by Y-fum-fcu-MOF. In fact, a strong relation between pores window size, kinetic diameter of the components and their adsorption behavior was observed.

The CNC used as nanoreinforcing fillers were extracted, at nanometric scale, from sugarcane bagasse fibers using sulfuric acid hydrolysis process, and their morphology and structure were characterized. Plasticized ALG films and plasticized ALG-CNC bionanocomposite films were prepared by solvent casting method. Before the casting process, the steady shear viscosity of film-forming solutions of all studied formulations was studied and compared. The obtained ALG-based films were successfully characterized in terms of their structure, transparency, water vapor permeability (WVP), moisture uptake (MU), thermal, and mechanical properties. It was found that all studied plasticized films keep the same transparency level of neat ALG films, thus suggesting that the selected plasticizers are compatible with the ALG biopolymer, and the CNC are well dispersed within the bionanocomposite films. The elastic modulus and tensile strength of neat ALG films were largely decreased after the addition of different plasticizers, while the elongation at break was significantly increased. However, these selected mechanical parameters were simultaneously improved when CNC are incorporated into plasticized ALG bionanocomposite films. The WVP and MU properties of ALG films were decreased when different plasticizers and CNC were added. Herein, the steps to form new eco-friendly ALG films were described by taking advantage of the combination of plasticizers and CNC with ALG biopolymer.

Hence, a judicious design of the user-UAV association and UAV locations is desired. A potential game is defined where the players are the UAVs. The potential function is the total sum rate of the users. The agents' utility in the potential game is their marginal contribution to the global welfare or their so-called wonderful life utility. A game-theoretic learning algorithm, binary log-linear learning (BLLL), is then applied to the problem. Given the potential game structure, a consequence of our utility design, the stochastically stable states using BLLL are guaranteed to be the potential maximizers. Hence, we optimally solve the joint user-UAV association and 3-D-location problem. Next, we exploit the submodular features of the sum rate function for a given configuration of UAVs to design an efficient greedy algorithm. Despite the simplicity of the greedy algorithm, it comes with a performance guarantee of 1 - 1/e of the optimal solution.

N applied to soil in the form of urine corresponded at rates of 20 and 64 g N m(-2) and net cumulative N2O emissions were 350 and 20 mg N2O-N m(-2) in Casanare and Atlantico, respectively. Despite low digestibility of offered diet, N recovery in milk was above the values reported at dairy cattle in tropical conditions. High urine-N inputs at Atlantico site did not result in high N2O emissions suggesting that the default Tier 1 emission factor (EF) which is based on N inputs would have overestimated urine-based N2O emissions in Atlantico. Comparing previous studies conducted in Colombia, we observed inter-regional differences by urine-based N2O emissions. This observation suggests that to increase certainty in estimating urine-based N2O emissions, Colombia needs to move toward more region-specific Tier 2 EF and reduce its dependence on the default IPCC Tier 1 EF. In addition, the adoption of Tier 2 EF in the cattle sector will facilitate accounting for the effect of animal diets on N2O inventories.","['cattle systems', ' milk urea nitrogen', ' cattle urine-based nitrogen', ' megathyrsus maximus', ' greenhous gases', 'BIOLOGICAL NITRIFICATION INHIBITION', ' N2O EMISSIONS', ' DAIRY-COWS', ' BOVINE URINE', ' METHANE', ' EXCRETA', ' PROTEIN', ' PASTURES', ' PATCHES', ' GRASS']",2021.0,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,['Food Science & Technology'],"['CGIAR', 'BBSRC', 'UK', 'BBSRCUK']",False,4,False,86

Assessment of groundwater mineralization of alluvial coastal aquifer of essaouira basin (Morocco) using the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram (HFE-Diagram),"['Bahir, M', ' Ouazar, D', ' Ouhamdouch, S', ' Zouari, K']","The relation between the hydrochemical variation and the marine intrusion in the coastal alluvial aquifer of Essaouira basin (Morocco) was characterized by the major ionic ratios, the ratio Br-/Cl-, the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram (HFE-Diagram), and by the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen (delta O-18 and delta H-2). The results of major ionic ratios have shown that groundwater mineralization is controlled by the dissolution phenomenon and by the inverse Bases Exchange phenomenon caused by the marine intrusion. Br-/Cl- ratio shows that some water points are contaminated by seawater. The application of HFE-Diagram shows that the samples of the 1990 are grouped in the SW + i(4) (52%) and i(3) (14%) sub-stages. The samples of 1995 campaign show an evolution from the i(1) (3%) sub-stage towards the FW + i(4) (38%) sub-stage by reflecting the advancement of seawater in the aquifer. Samples representing the 2009 campaign are characterized by the dominance of the f(1) (56%) sub-stage relative to the SW + i(4) (38%) sub-stage, suggesting the trend of the aquifer towards the equilibrium phase due to the significant recharge that known this aquifer. While the samples of the 2015 campaign are dominated by the i(3) (49%) and SW + i(4) (32%) sub-stages reflecting the re-contamination of the aquifer by seawater.

Furthermore, the effect of IL-based treatment on the tensile strength of cotton fabrics was evaluated using a uniaxial tensile test. The thermal behavior of cotton fabrics was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, microscale combustion calorimetry, limiting oxygen index (LOI) and vertical burning test. It was found that the as produced IL-treated cotton fabrics exhibited a good thermal stability and showed good flame retardant properties.

Chemical and mineralogical characterization, desorption kinetics, sequential extraction, leaching evaluation in columns and speciation using Xray absorption near edge structure were performed. Pb adsorbed on bentonite and on anglesite were the predominant species in the unamended soil. The treatments with phosphate and lime transformed part of the Pb species to pyromorphite. Conversely, part of Pb species was transformed to Pb adsorbed on citrate in the soil amended with biochar, while PbCl2 was formed in soil samples amended with biosolids. Phosphate and lime increased the Pb extracted in the residual fraction, thus showing that more recalcitrant species, such as pyromorphite, were formed. Biosolids and biochar treatments decreased the Pb in the residual fraction, and the fraction associated to organic matter increased after the addition of biosolids. Phosphate and lime were effective to immobilize Pb and to decrease Pb desorption kinetics, but the organic amendments increased the desorption kinetics of Pb in all rates applied.

Thermal degradation of ficus wood has been evaluated under dynamic conditions from 373 K to 1173 K at heating rates of 5, 10, 20, and 50 K.min(-1). The kinetic analysis was performed using isoconversional methods (Friedman (FR), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Vyazovkin (VYA)) and the integral master-plots method to estimate the kinetic triplets. The thermogravimetric and kinetic data were used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters (Delta G, Delta H and Delta S) and kinetic compensation effects. The conversion range of 0.05 <= x <= 0.9 shows clearly that the pyrolysis of ficus wood could represent a triple-step reaction, which corresponds to the pyrolysis of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, respectively. From the isoconversional plots of ficus wood having average activation energy values of 171.4-180.3 kJ.mol(-1), 206.48-214.42 kJ.mol(-1) and 237.85-248.23 kJ.mol(-1) for hemicellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively.

"Groundwater modeling in the Mediterranean area: case of the Gareb-Bouareg coastal aquifer (Rif, Morocco)","['Lyazidi, R', ' Hessane, MA', ' Moutei, JF', ' Bahir, M']","The Gareb-Bouareg aquifer is located in northeastern Morocco. This aquifer extends continuously and expansively under the two plains of Gareb and Bouareg. The introduction of irrigated agriculture utilizing only surface water to these plains has resulted in an alarming rise in the level of the water table, leading to waterlogging and salinization, which have adversely affected crop growth and rendered large areas of the plains unproductive. Therefore, a study of the water-table fluctuations in response to the agricultural development of this area was carried out. Two potential methods of lowering the water table of the brackish alluvial aquifer-the installation of subsurface and deep drainage networks-were proposed. Due to a lack of sufficient data at the local scale (agricultural parcels), it was not possible to simulate the functioning of the agricultural drainage system, so a regional MODFLOW model based on a hydrodynamic modeling approach was used to determine the optimal method of lowering the groundwater level and preventing it from rising above safe levels, thus preserving the quality of the soil and improving growing conditions for crops. After successful calibration and validation of the model, several pump-draining scenarios were simulated to evaluate their impacts on the water table in an area of the plains that suffers from waterlogging. The results for the most realistic scenario revealed that pump draining performed via 10 wells at a rate of 30 l/s per well (i.e., 300 l/s overall) would lower the water table by a maximum of 5.42 m, which would approximate its original level before the water table began to rise due to irrigation. The zone sensitive to this abstraction process would cover an area of approximately 14 km(2). This technique could be improved by reducing inflows through the use of water-saving irrigation practices and/or applying corrective measures to increase groundwater outflows, which would eventually be demineralized.","['Gareb-Bouareg coastal aquifer', ' Moulouya river basin', ' MODFLOW groundwater flow model', ' Groundwater modeling system (GMS)', ' Irrigation system network', ' Pump draining', ' Waterlogging', ' Morocco', 'UNCONFINED AQUIFER', ' WATER-RESOURCES', ' LAGOON', ' QUALITY', ' ZONES', ' FLOW']",2020.0,EURO-MEDITERR J ENVI,['Environmental Sciences & Ecology'],[''],False,1,False,32

Production of Microalgal Slow-Release Fertilizer by Valorizing Liquid Agricultural Digestate: Growth Experiments with Tomatoes,"['Jimenez, R', ' Markou, G', ' Tayibi, S', ' Barakat, A', ' Chapsal, C', ' Monlau, F']","Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is a process that is well-known and fast-developing in Europe. AD generates large amounts of digestate, especially in livestock-intensive areas. Digestate has potential environmental issues due to nutrients (such as nitrogen) lixiviation or volatilization. Using liquid digestate as a nutrient source for microalgae growth is considered beneficial because digestate could be valorized and upgraded by the production of an added value product. In this work, microalgal biomass produced using liquid digestate from an agricultural biogas plant was investigated as a slow-release fertilizer in tomatoes. Monoraphidium sp. was first cultivated at different dilutions (1:20, 1:30, 1:50), in indoor laboratory-scale trials. The optimum dilution factor was determined to be 1:50, with a specific growth rate of 0.13 d(-1) and a complete nitrogen removal capacity in 25 days of culture. Then, outdoor experiments were conducted in a 110 dm(3) vertical, closed photobioreactors (PBRs) in batch and semi-continuous mode with 1:50 diluted liquid digestate. During the batch mode, the microalgae were able to remove almost all NH4+ and 65 (+/- 13) % of PO43-, while the microalgal growth rate reached 0.25 d(-1). After the batch mode, the cultures were switched to operate under semi-continuously conditions. The cell densities were maintained at 1.3 x 10(7) cells mL(-1) and a biomass productivity around 38.3 mg TSS L-1 d(-1) during three weeks was achieved, where after that it started to decline due to unfavorable weather conditions. Microalgae biomass was further tested as a fertilizer for tomatoes growth, enhancing by 32% plant growth in terms of dry biomass compared with the control trials (without fertilization). Similar performances were achieved in tomato growth using synthetic fertilizer or digestate. Finally, the leaching effect in soils columns without plant was tested and after 25 days, only 7% of N was leached when microalgae were used, against 50% in the case of synthetic fertilizer.","['circular economy', ' growth plant tests', ' nutrients leaching', ' nutrients recycling', ' photo-bioreactor', ' slow released fertilizer', 'GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS', ' ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION', ' NUTRIENT REMOVAL', ' CULTIVATION', ' BIOMASS', ' FRACTION', ' METHANE', ' MANURE', ' REUSE', ' PLANT']",2020.0,APPL SCI-BASEL,"['Chemistry', ' Engineering', ' Materials Science', ' Physics']",['FRANCE'],False,1,False,46

Our aim was to show the added value of identifying external target values of the Sustainable Rice Platform''s 12 performance indicators in addition to internal descriptive statistics values such as median and top decile performance for each indicator. Using household survey data from 1499 households in seven favorable rice production areas across seven countries in Asia, we identified baseline and target values appropriate to each indicator and illustrated their use for three purposes: assessing the outcomes of an extension program, comparing tradeoffs associated with two widely-used crop establishment methods, and providing individual feedback to a farmer about how to improve farm performance. We worked with our large survey data set and external reference values to calculate specific target values for each of the 12 indicators. These target values were used to evaluate the effectiveness of an extension program, showing that the extension program resulted in an improvement in scores for most indicators but did not achieve the target values for any of them. A comparison of wet-direct seeded rice (widely practice in irrigated regions of Vietnam, Thailand, and Sri Lanka) vs. puddled transplanted rice (China, Indonesia, Myanmar) indicated that there was a trade-off with wet-direct seeding having better labor productivity and greenhouse gas emission but worse pesticide use, and that both establishment methods had lower profitability than the target value. For the advice provided to an individual farmer, it was useful to be able to show both what the neighbors' average performance was and how far that was from the target values.

Surrogate model based approach to predict fatigue stress field in multi-stranded cables,"['Belkhabbaz, A', ' Gueguin, M', ' Hafid, F', ' Yang, C', ' Allix, O', ' Ghidaglia, JM']","The mechanical behavior at contact points in high-voltage electrical cable conductors is simulated to find where damage may occur. The presented approach is based on a numerical model that is referred to as the wire model. The critical zones are detected by simulating the mechanical behavior of a cable conductor section with a large number of contacts. For the wire model, a relevant regularized contact law that improves convergence of the contact algorithm compared to the standard contact law is implemented. This model is validated by making comparisons with experimental results available in the literature for various conductors. However, this approach employs a costly finite element method. In order to reduce the evaluation cost and allow sensitivity analysis of the input parameters, a surrogate model is proposed to replace the initial wire model. The surrogate model approximates the input-output relationship of the costly wire model. The choice of the sampling method that allows selection of the best fitting surrogate model for this application is discussed, but comparisons show little influence on the obtained scores. The robustness of the obtained result depends mostly on the chosen surrogate model, where the scores obtained with random forest and neural network are better than the scores obtained with linear and polynomial regression.

Analysis for Improved Sowing Date for Winter Faba Bean in Morocco,"['Kibbou, F', ' El Bouhmadi, K', ' Ghanem, ME', ' Marrou, H', ' Sinclair, TR']","Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is a useful grain legume for production in Mediterranean climates due to its consumption as food for humans and feed for animals, and its ability to symbiotically fix atmospheric nitrogen. Currently, in Morocco a substantial fraction of faba bean is sown under a rainfed management scheme in which the crop is sown after about a 15-day delay following the first rains after the dry season. The 15-day delay allows weed seeds to germinate and be killed during land tillage prior to sowing of faba bean. However, the 15-day delay shortens the growing season and may negatively impact seed yield. Two alternate sowing date criteria were simulated for faba bean sowing date in Morocco as approaches to increase production. In addition to the 15-day delay management by farmers, sowing was simulated to occur immediately following accumulation of 10 mm or 25 mm of water in the soil. A geospatial analysis was undertaken using the SSM-faba bean model to simulate production on a 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid across Morocco. Eighty three locations were each simulated for 30 growing seasons of weather input. The simulation results for the 25-mm sowing date criteria resulted in decreased geographical area in which faba bean could be grown while the 10-mm sowing date criteria resulted in an expanded geographical area for faba bean production. The average yield based only on seasons in which sowing was achieved, was fairly stable among the sowing-date criteria. The probability of yield increase of the 10-mm sowing date criterion as compared to the 15-day delay sowing was greater than 50% in much of the area found suitable for faba bean production. Assuming an acceptable method for weed control for the 10-mm sowing date criterion, this alternate management could expand faba bean production in Morocco as compared to the current practice of a 15-delay in sowing date.","['Faba bean', ' Geospatial assessment', ' Morocco', ' Soil water', ' Sowing date', 'VICIA-FABA', ' SIMPLE-MODEL', ' NITROGEN ACCUMULATION', ' CANOPY DEVELOPMENT', ' WATER-DEFICIT', ' GRAIN LEGUMES', ' GROWTH', ' SIMULATION', ' YIELD', ' RISK']",2021.0,INT J PLANT PROD,['Agriculture'],[''],False,1,False,38

All reinforced chitosan-graphene films displayed improved mechanical, thermal, and antibacterial (S. aureus, E. coli) properties compared to native chitosan films. Hemolysis, intracellular catalase activity, and hemoglobin oxidation were also observed for these materials.

"Land gradient and configuration effects on yield, irrigation amount and irrigation water productivity in rice-wheat and maize-wheat cropping systems in Eastern India","['Devkota, KP', ' Yadav, S', ' Humphreys, E', ' Kumar, A', ' Kumar, P', ' Kumar, V', ' Malik, RK', ' Srivastava, AK']","Laser land levelling is expanding rapidly in the rice-wheat (RW) and maize-wheat (MW) systems of the IndoGangetic Plains of India and Pakistan. Current practice is to level to zero (0%) gradient, whereas a small gradient (e.g. 0.1%) is typically used in developed countries. Therefore, experiments were conducted in farmers' plots (-15 m x 40 m) in the Eastern Gangetic Plains to evaluate laser levelling with a 0.1% gradient in comparison with 0% and farmer levelling practice (FL). The study was conducted over two years in RW and MW systems. In the MW system, raised beds in plots lasered with 0% and 0.1% gradients were also evaluated. Laser levelling with 0% gradient significantly reduced irrigation amount and/or increased irrigation water productivity (WPi) in all crops/systems grown on the flat compared to FL except for wheat in the MW system. While there was a consistent trend for higher yield with a 0% gradient compared with FL, the differences were not significant in any crop/system. For the RW system, the results suggest no to marginal benefits in irrigation amount and WPi from levelling with a 0.1% gradient in comparison with 0% gradient. In that system, by far the bigger gains were from changing from FL to laser levelling with 0% gradient. This resulted in substantial reductions in irrigation amount, which greatly increased WPi in both crops (by -40%), while yield was not affected. Rice grown with FL was not profitable, but lasering with 0% gradient significantly increased gross margin for rice, wheat and the total RW system. As for the RW system, levelling to 0% with a flat configuration significantly increased WPi of both crops in the MW system compared to FL, but by a lesser proportion. Raised beds significantly increased yield of maize by 8% (0.5 t ha-1), reduced irrigation amount by 20% (40 mm) and increased WPi by 34% (1.0 kg m-3) in comparison with the laser levelled flat plots. Gross margin of the MW system on beds was 17-20% higher than FL, and gross margin with beds on a 0.1% gradient was significantly higher than either gradient on the flat. The results suggest that the gains from levelling with a 0.1% gradient compared to 0% are marginal; however, this may change if the goal of consolidation of small farmer plots into larger fields becomes a reality provided there is a proportionate increase in irrigation flow rates, and ability to drain.","['Raised beds', ' Slope', ' Advance time', ' Intake opportunity time', ' Mechanical transplanting', ' Bihar', 'MANAGEMENT', ' DRAINAGE', ' RAINFALL', ' ADOPTION', ' DESIGN', ' IMPACT', ' SOIL']",2021.0,AGR WATER MANAGE,"['Agriculture', ' Water Resources']","['BMGF', 'USAID']",False,2,False,49
"Nutrient expert (R) rice-an alternative fertilizer recommendation strategy to improve productivity, profitability and nutrient use efficiency of rice in Nepal","['Amgain, LP', ' Timsina, J', ' Dutta, S', ' Majumdar, K']","Nepal is a major rice producer of South Asia, feeding more than 20 million people of the country and abroad. However, productivity and profitability of rice are low in Nepal compared to other regional countries. Large yield gaps exist between attainable and farmers' yields and nutrient management is identified as one of the major reasons. Nutrient ExpertVR (NE), a decision-support tool based on site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) principles has been validated and applied in many countries of Asia and Africa as new recommendation protocol for nutrient management in selected crops, including rice. Present study used NEVR Rice as nutrient management protocol in farmers' fields across Terai and mid-hills regions of Nepal during 2014-2018. The study revealed that NE-based fertilizer recommendations resulted in increase in yield over 2.0 t.ha similar to 1 (p similar to 0.05) and double the profits compared to existing blanket fertilizer recommendation, and farmers' fertilizer practice. Due to large variations in slope, altitude, soil, and management, performance of NEVR varied across locations. Its performance was better in Terai due to flat lands and less variations in soil types, compared to sloping lands and varied soils of mid-hills. NE tool provided adequate guidance to apply the required rate of fertilizer that matched the crop requirement and soil nutrient supply of each farmer fields. The novelty of the study is introduction of a dynamic fertilizer recommendation approach that can supplement the existing static blanket recommendation system. We conclude that Nutrient ExpertVR - Rice can be considered as an effective tool for nutrient recommendation for rice in Nepal.","['Fertilizer', ' FFP', ' Soil Fertility', ' SSNM', ' Yield']",2021.0,J PLANT NUTR,['Plant Sciences'],[''],False,1,False,56
Valorization of Phosphate Mine Waste Rocks as Materials for Road Construction,"['Amrani, M', ' Taha, Y', ' Kchikach, A', ' Benzaazoua, M', ' Hakkou, R']","The road construction sector is a worldwide high consumer of natural aggregates. The use of unusual industrial by-products in road techniques can contribute to the conservation of non-renewable natural resources and the reduction of wastes produced by some industries. Phosphate waste rocks could be considered as potential alternative secondary raw materials in road construction. The use and valorization of these wastes is currently limited according to the Moroccan guide for road earthworks (GMTR). The guide has classified these materials as waste products, which consequently, cannot be used in road construction. However, phosphate waste rocks are sedimentary natural rocks which have not been subjected to any transformation other than mechanical fragmentation. The goal of this paper is to discuss key-properties of various phosphate mine waste rocks (PMWR) to be used as road materials. Samples were taken from different stockpiles in the phosphate mine site of Gantour in Morocco. The different waste rocks samples were characterized in terms of their physical, geotechnical, chemical, mineralogical and environmental properties using international testing norms. The obtained results showed that the studied PMWR presented satisfying characteristics; the specific (particle) density: s > 26 kN/m(3), Los Angeles abrasion: 45% < LA < 58%), methylene blue value MBV < 1 g/100g, organic matter: OM < 1% and plasticity index: PI < 20%. All PMWR were confirmed as possessing the requested geotechnical properties to be used as materials for embankments. Moreover, leaching tests showed that none of them released any contaminants. In field application, these materials have been also successfully used in in situ experimental pilot testing. Therefore, the PMWR have to be classified in the category of natural aggregates that are similar to conventional materials.","['civil engineering', ' valorization', ' phosphate mine waste rocks', ' natural aggregates', ' road techniques wet process', 'MARINE-SEDIMENTS', ' DEMOLITION WASTE', ' STEEL SLAG', ' FLY-ASH', ' BEHAVIOR']",2019.0,MINERALS-BASEL,"['Geochemistry & Geophysics', ' Mineralogy', ' Mining & Mineral Processing']","['OCP', 'CNRST']",True,2,False,43

A store-and-release cover system made of phosphate wastes was built to prevent water infiltration and the formation of AMD. This cover system should be vegetated with appropriate plants to ensure its long-term sustainability and allow its reintegration in the surrounding ecosystem. Several indigenous plant species were studied. The choice of plant species was based mainly on their tolerance to trace elements contained in the phosphate wastes, and their low capacity to translocate these metals to their aboveground parts in order to limit the risk of pollutants transfer along the food chain. The main metals and metalloids (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr) are determined in 13 dominant plants naturally colonizing the store-and-release cover and their rhizospheric soils. The results showed that the phosphate cover contained high concentrations of Cr (138.04 mg/kg), Cu (119.86 mg/kg) and Cd (10.67 mg/kg) exceeding the regulatory thresholds values (Cr > 100 mg/kg, Cu > 100 mg/kg, Cd > 3 mg/kg).

Expertise-based consensus building for MCGDM with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information,"['Sellak, H', ' Ouhbi, B', ' Frikh, B', ' Ikken, B']","The integration of a consensus reaching process (CRP) becomes paramount to make highly accepted group decisions in complex real-life multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problems. Notwithstanding, existing CRPs for MCGDM do neither exhaustively analyse the diversity in decision makers' expertise levels, nor they consider that (because of such diversity) individuals might exhibit distinct perceptions on the relative importance of evaluation criteria. In this study, we present a novel expertise-based consensus building model for MCGDM under a hesitant fuzzy linguistic setting. Firstly, an expertise identification approach is devised to objectively determine the expertise degree of each decision maker based on multiple features. The proposed approach allows to dynamically assigning importance weights to the decision makers' opinions based on their expertise, as well as intelligently combining their individually elicited subjective and objective criteria weights into meaningful expertise-dependent combinative weights. Then, a CRP for MCGDM problems is introduced based on an improved consensus measurement process and an expertise-based feedback mechanism that provides a highly tailored, personalised means of direction rules to guide decision makers during the consensus building process. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the application of the CRP, and a detailed comparison analysis is presented to verify the validity and accuracy of this study's proposal.","['Multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM)', ' Consensus reaching process (CRP)', ' Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs)', ' Expertise identification', ' Criteria weighting', 'GROUP DECISION-MAKING', ' AGGREGATION OPERATORS', ' REACHING PROCESS', ' MODEL', ' ASSESSMENTS', ' MINIMUM', ' WEIGHTS', ' SETS']",2019.0,INFORM FUSION,['Computer Science'],"['Moulay Ismail University', 'IRESEN']",False,2,False,47

Then, raw materials, consisting of 100% phosphate sludge, were fired at three temperatures (900, 1000, and 1100 degrees C) for bricks' making. Fired bricks were then characterized. Results showed that the sludge was non-plastic and mainly composed of fluoroapatite (similar to 16%), calcite (similar to 23%) and clays (similar to 22%). An improvement in bricks porosity (-31%), firing shrinkage (similar to 31%), water absorption (similar to 27%), and flexural strength (similar to 71%) was observed with the increase of firing temperature from 900 to 1100 degrees C. Optimal properties of fired bricks were obtained at 1100 degrees C, with porosity of 9%, firing shrinkage of 7.5%, water absorption of 12.5%, bulk density of 1.4 g/cm(3) and flexural strength of 13.4 MPa.

RC levels ranged from 8.00 to 99.67% and were generally higher than the RC levels reported from other similar nurseries in Ethiopia. SA levels ranged from 1 to 25 spores g(-1)and were comparable with some reports from the field in Ethiopia but they were lower than levels reported by another similar study. RC was more affected by host species than nursery location, while the reverse was true for SA. The results also showed that nursery management could improve AMF status among seedlings.

Methods: A cross sectional survey of Spanish adults was conducted. The final sample consisted of 504 individuals who were administered a self-report questionnaire including the measures of demographic characteristics, Stages of Change, Processes of Change, Self-efficacy and Decisional Balance. Data were analysed by frequency analysis, MANOVA/ANOVA and correlation analysis. Results: Findings indicated that most of the behavioural and cognitive processes of change, self-efficacy and physical cons differentiated participants across the stages of change of blood donation. In contrast, eligibility cons and pros were less influential in stage transitions.

How Does Mechanical Pearling Affect Quinoa Nutrients and Saponin Contents?,"['Rafik, S', ' Rahmani, M', ' Rodriguez, JP', ' Andam, S', ' Ezzariai, A', ' El Gharous, M', ' Karboune, S', ' Choukr-Allah, R', ' Hirich, A']","Agriculture is facing many challenges, such as climate change, drought, and salinity, which call for urgent interventions for fast adaptation and crop diversification. The introduction of high-value and stress tolerant crops such as quinoa would be a judicious solution to overcome constraints related to abiotic stress and to increase land productivity and farmers' incomes. The implementation of quinoa in Morocco has not been supported by a full valorization program to control the quality of quinoa seeds. The novelty of this work is to assess the pearling operation as an efficient method of saponins removal as well as the determination of total residual saponins. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of several pearling durations on nutrient and saponin content of quinoa seeds of three tested varieties (Puno, Titicaca, and ICBA-Q5). Five pearling durations were tested (0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 min) using a locally manufactured pearling machine. The results indicated that a pearling duration of two minutes was enough to reduce total saponin content from 0.49% to 0.09% for Puno variety, from 0.37% to 0.07% for Titicaca variety, and from 0.57% to 0.1% for ICBA-Q5 variety. Our results showed that pearling slightly reduced protein, total fat, and moisture contents for all varieties except for Puno, where total fat content slightly increased with the pearling. Puno variety had the highest seed content in terms of protein and total fat; the ICBA-Q5 variety had the lowest. Titicaca had the highest bran content in terms of protein and total fat, ICBA-Q5 had the highest bran content in terms of ash and the lowest bran content in terms of protein and total fat, and Puno had the lowest bran content in terms of ash. Pearling had no significant effect on macronutrient contents in the processed seed, but it resulted in a very highly significant difference for most of them in the bran except for Mg and S. Regarding seed content in terms of micro-nutrients, statistical analysis showed significant differences between varieties in terms of Zn, Cu, and Mn contents, but no significant difference was recorded for Fe or B. Pearling had no significant effect on seed micronutrient contents. Therefore, to retain maximum nutritional content in the quinoa and maintain quinoa integrity, it is necessary to limit the pearling duration of quinoa to two minutes, which is enough to reduce saponin content below the Codex Standard threshold (0.12%).","['pearling', ' postharvest', ' saponin', ' minerals', ' processing', ' seed bran', ' quinoa seeds quality', ' nutrition', 'CHENOPODIUM-QUINOA', ' ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES', ' AMARANTH', ' QUANTIFICATION', ' IRRIGATION', ' MINERALS', ' PROFILE', ' WILLD.', ' YIELD', ' ACID']",2021.0,PLANTS-BASEL,['Plant Sciences'],['IDRC'],False,1,False,56

Topsoil (1-10 cm) physicochemical property, AMF spore abundance (SA), and AMF infectivity were determined across four land uses, viz., natural forest (NF), shrubland (ShL), cropland (CrL), and grazing land (GrL). According to the permutational multivariate analysis of variance and nonmetric multidimensional scaling results, soil physicochemical property was resilient to degradation (NF-ShL conversion) but not deforestation (NF-CrL or NF-GrL conversions) of CF. The one-way ANOVA results indicated that most soil physicochemical variables were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by land-use change. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen, in particular, reduced significantly (p < 0.05) by up to 48% and 57% due to NF-CrL and NF-GrL conversions, respectively. Whereas SA was found to be resilient to both CF degradation and deforestation, AMF infectivity was resilient only to NF-CrL conversion. Generally, our results did not show a similar pattern in soil physicochemical property, SA, and AMF infectivity resilience to degradation and deforestation. However, in the case of NF-GrL conversion, both soil physicochemical property and AMF infectivity exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) low resilience. Based on our results, we conclude that soil physicochemical property and AMF are important factors to consider in CF restoration planning.

In the case of a monolayer black phosphorene, it is found that strain along the armchair direction slightly affects thealattice parameter and the puckering height (Delta). Along the zigzag direction, however, variation of thealattice parameter is compensated by both theaandblattice variations while the parameter Delta remains unaffected. In the case of bilayer and trilayer black phosphorene, a similar behavior is observed where the layer-spacing d acts as an additional degree of liberty for strain compensation. In terms of electronic properties, strain along the armchair and zigzag directions changes the nature of the Gamma point in the bandgap from a direct to an indirect electronic transition as a function of the strain value. In the strain range from -14% to +6%, all black phosphorene structures behave similarly to classical semiconductors. However, the size and strain combined effect significantly affects the Fermi energy position. Around 0% strain, all black phosphorene structures are ofp-type, while they switch to ann-typesemiconductor in the range of strain values from +2% up to +14%.

Impacts of mining activities on soil properties: case studies from Morocco mine sites,"['Benidire, L', ' Benidire, L', ' Boularbah, A']","Due to its very rich and varied geological heritage, the Moroccan subsoil contains many mining deposits that are subject to large-scale exploitation and extraction (mainly phosphates, base metals and precious metals) assigning to this sector an important role in the country's economic development. However, the exploitation of these mineral resources can present serious negative influence on the environment. Indeed, mining activities can disrupt natural environments in several ways, e.g. by altering landscapes, depositing large amounts of hazardous tailings and discharging polluted liquid and atmospheric effluents. Thus, it causes significant environmental damage with negative impacts on air, water and soil quality as well as the loss of biodiversity. Growing concerns about the consequences of mining activities, particularly mining waste, have led many researchers to assess the extent of the environmental damage they have caused. This review summarizes the most important research finding published on the environmental impact assessment of mining industries. Particular attention is paid to some metal ore mines, mainly abandoned ones, occurring across Morocco. The results of the environmental assessments have shown that the abandoned tailings dumps have caused severe contamination of the environment and its compartments. However, the major impact was observed in soils around the mining zones. Thus, particularly in sulphide-rich mines, such as Kettara, Draa Lasfar, Ouixane, Axara and Setolazar mines, the tailings with high acid-generating potential have led to a significant pH level decrease (down to pH 2) and to a severe metal contamination of soils.

The ratio between the desirable alpha-phase black perovskite and the undesirable delta yellow phase is studied as a function of Li content in the film. Our results show that the presence of a small amount of Li ions can have a huge impact on the structural, optical and photophysical properties of the FAPbI(3) layer by enhancing the formation of delta-FAPbI(3) instead of the black alpha-FAPbI(3) phase. The structural analyses show that the FAPbI(3) doped by Li atoms leads to the distortion of the mean alpha-FAPbI(3) perovskite structure due the appearance of non-perovskite structure based delta-FAPbI(3). The optical measurements indicate a clear decrease of the absorbance with increasing the Li content. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the Li doped FAPbI(3) decreases considerably indicating a significant quenching and enhanced carrier extraction after Li doping.

The transformation of this waste into valuable and marketable products would help to improve waste disposal. Indeed, the large annual production of this waste makes it a sustainable and renewable bio-source for the production of chemicals and fibers for advanced applications. In this work, new cellulose microfibrils (CMFs) with a tendril helical morphology and highly hydrated gel-like behavior were successfully extracted from CBS waste using a controlled chemical extraction process. During this study, several physico-chemical characterizations were carried out in order to identify the properties of each of the products at different stages of treatment.

Water Scenarios Modelling for Renewable Energy Development in Southern Morocco,"['Ersoy, SR', ' Terrapon-Pfaff, J', ' Ribbe, L', ' Merrouni, AA']","Water and energy are two pivotal areas for future sustainable development, with complex linkages existing between the two sectors. These linkages require special attention in the context of the energy transition. Against this background, this paper analyses the role of water availability in the development of solar thermal and photovoltaic power plants for the case of the Draa Valley in southern Morocco. Located in a semi-arid to arid mountainous area, the Draa Valley faces high water stress - a situation expected to worsen due to climate change. At the same time, the region has one of the greatest potentials for solar energy in the world. To examine whether limited water availability could accelerate or delay the implementation of solar thermal and photovoltaic power plants, this paper compares regional water availability and demand in the Draa Valley for different scenarios, paying particular attention to potential socio-economic development pathways. The Water Evaluation and Planning System software is applied to allocate the water resources in the study region. The water supply is modelled under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate scenario, while the water demand for the Draa Valley is modelled for a combination of three socio-economic and two energy scenarios. The climate scenario describes a significant decrease in water availability by 2050, while the socio-economic and energy scenarios show an increase in water demand. The results demonstrate that during a sequence of dry years the reservoirs water availability is reduced and shortages in water supply can result in high levels of unmet demand. If this situation occurs, oasis farming, water for drinking and energy production could compete directly with each other for water resources. The energy scenarios indicate that the use of dry cooling technologies in concentrated solar power and photovoltaic hybrid systems could be one option for reducing competition for the scarce water resources in the region. However, given that energy generation accounts for only a small share of the regional water demand, the results also suggest that socio-economic demand reduction, especially in the agricultural sector, for example by reducing the cultivated area, will most likely become necessary.","['Water evaluation and planning', ' Water demand modelling', ' Hybrid concentrated solar power-photovoltaic systems', ' Scenario', ' Socio-economic development', ' Morocco', 'POWER']",2021.0,J SUSTAIN DEV ENERGY,['Environmental Sciences & Ecology'],"['BMBF', 'IRESEN']",False,2,False,62

Also, the environmental investigations showed that CMWR does not present any potential contaminating risk on the surrounding environment and most of the pyrite particles were already oxidized.

The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) has a global mandate for barley improvement and holds rich in-trust collections of cultivated and wild Hordeum species. The present study aims to evaluate 117 accessions of Hordeum spontaneum for their contents of beta-glucan and microelements for breeding new varieties with enhanced nutritional value. The bulked seed accessions of Hordeum spontaneum were grown over two seasons, and the single plant derived seeds from these accessions were compared to 36 elite lines and varieties of cultivated barley in the second season in Morocco. The results showed large differences in beta-glucan and microelements in both the bulk and the single plant seed accessions. The contents of beta-glucans ranged from 1.44 to 11.3% in the Hordeum spontaneum accessions and from 1.62 to 7.81% in the cultivated barley lines. Large variations were found for the microelements content, but no differences were noticed between the wild and the cultivated species. However, some accessions of Hordeum spontaneum had higher combined contents of Iron, Zinc, and Selenium.

Effects of horticulture on soil organic matter properties in highly weathered tropical soils,"['Barreto, MSC', ' Schellekens, J', ' Ramlogan, M', ' Rouff, AA', ' Elzinga, EJ', ' Vidal-Torrado, P', ' Alleoni, LRF']","Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role not only for agriculture but also in the global carbon (C) balance with a potential to mitigate climate change. Land-use changes from native vegetation to intensive agricultural use enhance mineralization of SOM and thereby cause decreases in the amount of soil C. Association of SOM on soil minerals is highlighted as key stabilization mechanism of SOM. To examine the contribution of land-use change and soil mineralogy on soil C losses, soils with different soil mineralogy assemblage were studied from four areas in Brazil, all having sites with agriculture and nearby soils under native vegetation. We assessed SOM stability by thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the molecular composition of functional soil C pools by pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). On average, 33 % of soil C was lost in three sites after land-use change. Py-GC/MS indicates a dominance of reworked and/or microbial material (58-99 % N-containing products and carbohydrates), and low contribution from plant-derived products such as lignin phenols (from 0.1 to 7.7 %), and striking similarities in molecular composition between native vegetation and corresponding sites under agriculture. Thermal data indicate lower energy content in soils under native vegetation than agriculture, confirming microbial-derived SOM. The gibbsite content was positively correlated to N-containing products in both SOM extracted by alkaline solution (r(2) = 0.60) and SOM residual after alkaline extraction (r(2) = 0.82), while the kaolinite content showed a negative correlation with N-containing compounds (r(2) = 0.72) and a positive one with carbohydrates (r(2) = 0.48). Thus although SOM content highly decreased upon horticulture, both Py-GC/MS and thermal analyses indicate that SOM composition is mainly controlled by site instead of land-use, and the strong correlations with clay minerals suggest a mineralogical control on SOM composition.","['Soil carbon storage', ' Land-use change', ' Thermal analysis', ' Pyrolysis-GC/MS', ' Mineral-associated OM', 'LAND-USE CHANGE', ' GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE', ' THERMAL-ANALYSIS', ' MOLECULAR COMPOSITION', ' VEGETABLE PRODUCTION', ' BIOLOGICAL STABILITY', ' CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION', ' ANALYTICAL PYROLYSIS', ' SUBTROPICAL SOILS', ' HUMIC SUBSTANCES']",2021.0,SOIL TILL RES,['Agriculture'],"['FAPESP', 'CAPES', 'CNPQ']",False,3,False,120

When fixed to iron and aluminum oxyhydroxides in highly weathered soils, P is covalently linked to the soil solid phase and becomes unavailable to crops. Plants and microorganisms produce organic acids as a strategy to acquire P for growth. These compounds have been used to extract P from sparingly soluble phosphate minerals and may play a role in reverting P adsorption and fixation in the soil. The objective of this work was to study the ability of Aspergillus niger FS1 and organic acids to desorb P after 40 d of contact of the nutrient with 75-mu m fractions of a typical highly weathered Oxisol. Samples of the soil fractions from the A and B horizons were incubated for 40 d with P at concentrations corresponding to 90% of the soil maximum P adsorption capacity (MPAC). The ability of A. niger FS1 to desorb P from the soil was performed in a culture medium optimized for phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms. The desorption kinetics of the P bound to the soil fractions was evaluated for oxalic acid at 10 mmol L-1, and for a mixture of oxalic + citric acids, both at 5 mmol L-1. Water at pH 7.0 and at pH 2.0 was used as controls. The fungus released 18.0% of the P from the A and B horizon fractions after 7 days of growth. Oxalic acid was the most efficient compound at desorbing P from the soil, releasing 32.7% of the P from the A horizon fraction, and 18.5%, for the B horizon fraction. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of microbial P release from highly weathered soils, opening prospects for the development of microbial techniques allowing plant access to P fixed in the soils and the improvement of P fertilizer use efficiency.","['Oxisol', ' P adsorption', ' Phosphate solubilizing microorganisms', ' Soil phosphorus cycling', 'PHOSPHATE SOLUBILIZATION', ' ADSORPTION', ' DESORPTION', ' FERMENTATION', ' KINETICS', ' RELEASE', ' OXALATE', ' OXISOLS', ' LIQUID', ' GROWTH']",2021.0,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,['Agriculture'],"['FAPEMIG', 'CNPQ', 'CAPES']",False,3,False,62

The movements made by system users can provide valuable information on many aspects of urban life including the spatial and temporal dynamics of travel in the city, on the place of the bicycle among other modes of transport, or on the distribution of territorial and social inequalities in geographical space. In this paper, we study the problem of intelligent management of shared bicycle systems. Indeed, the management of these systems faces many optimization problems in its procession. Thus, to improve the BSS user's satisfaction, it's useful to inform the actors/ users in this system about the state of bike sharing for a station.

The study also aimed to identify the main hotspots of adverse environmental impacts and propose possible mitigation options and their cost-effectiveness. The impact categories were estimated using the 2006 IPCC and the 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC guidelines, databases, and locally estimated emission factors. The functional units used were 1 kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and 1 kg live weight gain (LWG), leaving the farm gate. Three methods of allocating environmental burdens to meat and milk products were applied: economic, energy, and mass allocation. The adoption of improved pastures was considered a mitigation measure, and an economic assessment was performed to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of its establishment. A principal component multivariate analysis and a Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components were performed. The economic allocation method assigned a greater environmental burden tomeat (83%), followed by energy content (80%) and mass production (73%). The largest sources of GHG emissions were enteric fermentation and manure deposited on pasture.

In this study, we used an artificial neural network (ANN) approach and a modified Universal Soil Loss Equation coupled with multiple linear regression (MUSLE-MLR) model to predict yearly sedimentation in the Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah reservoir, located in a semi-arid region of Morocco. To construct the MUSLE-MLR model, we first calibrated and validated the MUSLE on 32 storms at four gauging stations upstream of the dam to estimate the sediment yield at these four gauging stations; we then developed the MLR model for combining sediment yield and reservoir sedimentation. The results of this model were then compared with the performance of the ANN model that was trained and validated over the periods 1975-2008 and 2009-2015, respectively. The comparison revealed that the calibrated MUSLE model is fairly useful to predict sediment yield at the watershed level. However, comparison of the two models during the validation process showed that the ANN (R(2)0.91, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency [NSE] 0.820) is more accurate and more suitable than the MUSLE-MLR model (R(2)0.819,NSE- 1.592) to predict reservoir sediment in the Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah reservoir.

The chitosan composite preparation and characterization were deeply investigated. The montmorillonite (MMT) clay incorporation as filler improves the water barrier diffusion, mechanical properties, and thermal stability of the composite. The combination of the swelling behavior of the chitosan-day composite (inner coating) and the hydrophobic property of paraffin wax (outer coating) was confirmed by the water holding capacity evaluation and the phosphorus release essays in water and soil. Indeed, the phosphorus dissolution from the coated DAP granules was significantly delayed compared to the uncoated DAP.

The perennial hydrophyte, Potamogeton perfoliatus, has been used traditionally to treat several health disorders; however, little is known about its biological and its medicinal effects. Here, we used an integrated in vitro and in vivo framework to examine the potential effect of P. perfoliatus on oxidative stress, nociception, inflammatory models, and brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia in mice. Our results suggested a consistent in vitro inhibition of three enzymes, namely 5-lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), as well as a potent antioxidant effect. These results were confirmed in vivo where the studied extract attenuated carrageenan-induced paw edema, carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration into the peritoneal cavity by 25, 44 and 64% at 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg, p.o., respectively. Moreover, the extract decreased acetic acid-induced vascular permeability by 45% at 600 mg/kg, p.o., and chemical hyperalgesia in mice by 86% by 400 mg/kg, p.o., in acetic acid-induced writhing assay. The extract (400 mg/kg) showed a longer response latency at the 3 h time point (2.5 fold of the control) similar to the nalbuphine, the standard opioid analgesic. Additionally, pronounced antipyretic effects were observed at 600 mg/kg, comparable to paracetamol. Using LC-MS/MS, we identified 15 secondary metabolites that most likely contributed to the obtained biological activities. Altogether, our findings indicate that P. perfoliatus has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and antipyretic effects, thus supporting its traditional use and promoting its valorization as a potential candidate in treating oxidative stress-associated diseases.","['Potamogeton perfoliatus', ' inflammation', ' analgesia', ' antipyretic', ' antioxidant', 'L.', ' ANTIOXIDANT', ' MODELS', ' EDEMA', ' YEAST']",2021.0,MOLECULES,"['Biochemistry & Molecular Biology', ' Chemistry']",['UMP'],False,1,True,42

Calcium enhances adsorption and thermal stability of organic compounds on soil minerals,"['Barreto, MSC', ' Elzinga, EJ', ' Ramlogan, M', ' Rouff, AA', ' Alleoni, LRF']","Increasing organic matter storage in highly weathered soils is an important strategy to improve soil fertility and to help mitigate rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels that may cause climate change. High calcium (Ca) availability in soils resulting from lime and gypsum application may increase soil organic matter contents, and this is frequently attributed to increased adsorption of organic molecules by soil minerals. Here, we evaluated the effects of Ca on the thermal stability of organo-mineral associations in a synthetic mineral mixture of kaolinite, goethite, and aluminum (Al)-oxides mimicking the mineralogy of the clay-size fraction of weathered tropical soils. Sorption experiments were carried out with humic acid (HA) at pH 6.5 and 4.5, using Ca concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 0.4 mM. Adsorption of HA increased with decreasing pH. The presence of 0.4 mM Ca increased HA adsorption by a factor of approximately 2.4 at pH 6.5 and 1.6 at pH 4.5. The thermal stability of HA increased upon Ca addition, suggesting that Ca strengthens HA-mineral bonding. UV-Vis analyses indicated that HA is fractionated during sorption in all treatments, and that fractionation may increase in the presence of Ca, possibly by enhanced preferential adsorption of HA compounds of relatively low molecular weight. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic results indicated that HA adsorbed primarily through the carboxylate moieties under all conditions. Our combined results show that dissolved Ca not only increases the extent of HA adsorption by soil minerals, but may also enhance the chemical stability and change the physical-chemical properties of sorbed HA compounds. A stronger association of organic compounds with mineral surfaces in the presence of Ca may be a significant contributing factor to Ca-promoted OM accumulation in soils.","['Soil organic matter', ' Mineral surfaces', ' Adsorption', ' Calcium', ' Thermal analysis', ' Polyvalent cation bridging', ' In-situ infrared spectroscopy', ' UV-Vis spectroscopy', 'AQUATIC HUMIC SUBSTANCES', ' SOCIETY SOURCE CLAYS', ' FULVIC-ACID', ' NO-TILL', ' MATTER STABILITY', ' TROPICAL OXISOLS', ' ALUMINUM-OXIDE', ' GAMMA-ALUMINA', ' BASE-LINE', ' CARBON']",2021.0,CHEM GEOL,['Geochemistry & Geophysics'],"['FAPESP', 'CAPES', 'CNPQ']",False,3,False,104

By subjecting CMF to sulfuric and citric/hydrochloric mixture acids hydrolysis, sulfated CNC (S-CNC) and carboxylated CNC (C-CNC) have been produced with a diameter of 7.3 +/- 2.2 and 6.1 +/- 2.8 nm, and a length of 431 +/- 94 and 352 +/- 79 nm, respectively.

Separation of phosphoric acid sludge: effect of flocculation on settling and P2O5 recovery rates,"['Jouraiphy, R', ' Anouar, I', ' Mazouz, H', ' Mendil, J', ' Ibnlfassi, A']","Phosphoric acid sludge is one of the prominent problems in the phosphate industry. Its formation is co-occurred by considerable losses of P2O5 that affect the process performance. Management and valorization of this waste is a key issue. This work aimed to deal with this industrial concern by studying the influence of the flocculation on the sludge sedimentation and thus the P2O5 recovery rate. The flocculation tests were conducted in the presence of various types of anionic polymers. The effect of dosage, molecular weight, and type of flocculant were examined. The results indicated that all polymers showed settling performance improvement. And, the flocculant with the highest molecular weight (F1), showed the best settling performance with a pace of 3.3 cm/min and the lowest turbidity value of 40.4 NTU using a dosage of 5 ppm. Due to its high molecular weight, this polymer carries a polyelectrolyte bridging mechanism, which allows the absorbed polymer to move further away from the surface of the particle and then increases the particle radius, the number of collisions, and thus the particle size. However, for the P2O5 recovery rate, the sulfonic polymer (F5) was the best performer allowing recovery of 78.8% of the total mass of the sludge. F5 is weakly amphoteric. Polymers containing sulfonic acid groups are known to be inherently powerful than the carboxylic acid groups as they are stable due to their high energy barrier. According to the results, the flocculation increases the recovery of P2O5, which represents a profit of more than 30 kg of clarified phosphoric acid per 1 tone of sludge.","['phosphoric acid sludge', ' flocculation', ' P2O5 recovery rate', ' dosage', ' molecular weight', 'WASTE-WATER', ' FLOC SIZE', ' SUSPENSIONS', ' KAOLIN', ' PH']",2020.0,PHYSICOCHEM PROBL MI,"['Chemistry', ' Mining & Mineral Processing']",[''],False,1,False,53

The procedure of the proposed MPPT-SPF strategy is based on a polynomial model to characterize data from the PV module with a global fit. The advantage of using polynomials is that they provide a good fit within a predefined data range even though they can diverge greatly from that range. The MPPT-SPF strategy is integrated with a DC-DC boost converter to verify its performance and its interaction with different control loops. Therefore, the MPPT strategy is applied to the reference outer PI control loop, which in turn provides the current reference to the inner current loop based on a discrete-time sliding current control. A real-time and high-speed simulator (PLECS RT Box 1) and a digital signal controller (DSC) are used to implement the hardware-in-the-loop system to obtain the results. The proposed strategy does not have a high computational cost and can be implemented in a commercial low-cost DSC (TI 28069M).

We profiled their chemical composition and found many phenolic acids, flavonoids, and phenolic diterpenes. In this work, we investigated their antioxidant properties on HaCaT cells exposed to UVA-induced oxidative stress and examined their effects against chronic neuropathic pain and the underlying mechanisms. Through a rat chronic constriction injury (CCI) model, we induced chronic neuropathic pain by placing 4 loose ligatures around the right sciatic nerve for 14 days. Thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in addition to cold and dynamic allodynia were tested on the day before surgery and on the 7th and 14th post-surgery days. Key markers of the nitrosative and oxidative stresses, in addition to markers of inflammation, were measured at day 14 post surgery. Histopathological examination and immunostaining of both synaptophysin and caspase-3 of sciatic nerve and brain stem were also performed. Results of this study showed that T. algeriensis extract suppresses UVA oxidative stress in HaCaT cells via activation of the Nrf-2 pathway. Both extracts attenuated hyperalgesia and allodynia at 7- and 14-days post-surgery with more prominent effects at day 14 of surgery. Their protective effects against neuropathic pain were mediated by inhibiting NOX-1, iNOS, by increasing the enzyme activity of catalase, and inhibition of inflammatory mediators, NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, lipoxygenase, COX-2 enzymes, and PGE2. Furthermore, they improved deleterious structural changes of the brainstem and sciatic nerve. They also attenuated the increased caspase-3 and synaptophysin.

Bacterial Communities of the Canola Rhizosphere: Network Analysis Reveals a Core Bacterium Shaping Microbial Interactions,"[""Floc'h, JB"", ' Hamel, C', ' Lupwayi, N', ' Harker, KN', ' Hijri, M', ' St-Arnaud, M']","The rhizosphere hosts a complex web of prokaryotes interacting with one another that may modulate crucial functions related to plant growth and health. Identifying the key factors structuring the prokaryotic community of the plant rhizosphere is a necessary step toward the enhancement of plant production and crop yield with beneficial associative microorganisms. We used a long-term field experiment conducted at three locations in the Canadian prairies to verify that: (1) the level of cropping system diversity influences the alpha- and beta-diversity of the prokaryotic community of canola (Brassica napus) rhizosphere; (2) the canola rhizosphere community has a stable prokaryotic core; and (3) some highly connected taxa of this community fit the description of hub-taxa. We sampled the rhizosphere of canola grown in monoculture, in a 2-phase rotation (canola-wheat), in a 3-phase rotation (pea-barley-canola), and in a highly diversified 6-phase rotation, five and eight years after cropping system establishment. We detected only one core bacterial Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) in the prokaryotic component of the microbiota of canola rhizosphere, a hub taxon identified as cf.Pseudarthrobactersp.

Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Communities of Native Plant Species under High Petroleum Hydrocarbon Contamination HighlightsRhizophagusas a Key Tolerant Genus,"['Lee, SJ', ' Kong, MX', ' St-Arnaud, M', ' Hijri, M']","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to play an important role in increasing plant fitness in harsh conditions. Therefore, AMF are currently considered to be effective partners in phytoremediation. However, AMF communities in high levels of petroleum pollution are still poorly studied. We investigated the community structures of AMF in roots and rhizospheric soils of two plant species,Eleocharis ellipticaandPopulus tremuloides, growing spontaneously in high petroleum-contaminated sedimentation basins of a former petrochemical plant (91,000 mu g/Kg of C10-C50 was recorded in a basin which is 26-fold higher than the threshold of polluted soil in Quebec, Canada). We used a PCR cloning, and sequencing approach, targeting the 18S rRNA gene to identify AMF taxa. The high concentration of petroleum-contamination largely influenced the AMF diversity, which resulted in less than five AMF operational taxonomical units (OTUs) per individual plant at all sites. The OTUs detected belong mainly to the Glomerales, with some from the Diversisporales and Paraglomerales, which were previously reported in high concentrations of metal contamination. Interestingly, we found a strong phylogenetic signal in OTU associations with host plant species identity, biotopes (roots or soils), and contamination concentrations (lowest, intermediate and highest). The genusRhizophaguswas the most dominant taxon representing 74.4% of all sequences analyzed in this study and showed clear association with the highest contamination level. The clear association ofRhizophaguswith high contamination levels suggests the importance of the genus for the use of AMF in bioremediation, as well as for the survey of key AMF genes related to petroleum hydrocarbon resistance. By favoring plant fitness and mediating its soil microbial interactions,Rhizophagusspp. could enhance petroleum hydrocarbon pollutant degradation by both plants and their microbiota in contaminated sites.","['arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi', ' community structure', ' Petroleum-hydrocarbon contamination', ' PCR', ' cloning and sequencing', ' Ribosomal RNA', ' extreme environment', ' tolerance', ' Rhizophagus', 'DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS', ' GLOMUS-IRREGULARE', ' SUNFLOWER PLANTS', ' DIVERSITY', ' STRESS', ' ALIGNMENT', ' SPORES', ' GENES']",2020.0,MICROORGANISMS,['Microbiology'],['NSERC'],False,1,False,54

Experiments were carried out with different types of leachate, (Young (YL), Intermediate (IL) and Old (OL)) used at different concentrations of the leachate up to 100%. The organic fraction of landfill leachate was measured by biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) then it was qualitatively assessed using three dimensional excitation emission matrix (3D-EEM). The nitrogen fraction was measured by ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). The experiments revealed that, BOD5, COD and NH4+ removal rates after 4 weeks of treatment in flasks were within the ranges of 47.90-81.63%, 12.91-48.50% and 70.84-98.81%, respectively and that affected the reduction of the phytotoxicity in a positive way. A. flavus with 25% concentration of YL recorded the best results in reducing COD and BOD5 with maximum removal rates of around 48.50% and 81.63%, respectively. However, the highest NH4+ removal rate of 98.81% was found in 25% concentration of OL. The 3D-EEM results showed that the intensities of the fluorescent peaks for the three treated leachates have decreased sharply after treatment. This was confirmed by the increase of the organic matter complexity index for different treatments (from 0.55 to 0.87).

Untreated MT and agricultural soil were analyzed immediately, and 8 months after incorporating the amendments. Results and discussion Heterotrophic microorganisms were not recovered from untreated MT due to the highly acidic pH and available metal concentrations. However, the addition of organo-mineral amendments ameliorated the tailings' characteristics by increasing pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, and available P levels. Moreover, after 8 months, heterotrophic microorganisms were recovered from those substrates and dehydrogenase activity was enhanced. The incorporation of agricultural soil and green waste compost mixed either with lime (S5) or rock phosphate (S6) was the most effective treatment.

This study investigates the feasibility of using flint as full aggregate replacement of natural gravel in concrete mixes. Several tests were carried out to determine their physical, chemical, mineralogical properties and mechanical performances according to European standard for concrete. Flint aggregates consist mainly of quartz and traces of dolomite and fluorapatite. Their geotechnical and physical properties are similar to natural aggregates used for concrete. Dry and wet abrasion values measured by Los Angeles and Micro-Deval tests are respectively 19 and 9.8. Flint-based concrete was prepared alongside a control concrete made of natural aggregates targeting a B25 concrete category (25 MPa), and it indicated an average of 29 MPa at 28 days versus 34.4 MPa at 28 days for the reference sample. Flint-based concrete has also indicated higher performances in terms of flexural strengths, reaching an average of 4.90 MPa. In addition, SEM microstructural characterization confirms that the Interfacial transition zone (ITZ) is stronger in the case of flint-based concrete compared to control concrete. Those performances mean that concrete based flint from phosphate mine waste rocks can successfully substitute the ordinary concrete in the civil engineering constructions, which will enhance the circular economy concept, and contribute as a solution to achieve a greener mining activity.

Pyrochars from bioenergy residue as novel bio-adsorbents for lignocellulosic hydrolysate detoxification,"['Monlau, F', ' Sambusiti, C', ' Antoniou, N', ' Zabaniotou, A', ' Solhy, A', ' Barakat, A']","The robust supramolecular structure of biomass often requires severe pretreatments conditions to produce soluble sugars. Nonetheless, these processes generate some inhibitory compounds (i.e. furans compounds and aliphatic acids) deriving mainly from sugars degradation. To avoid the inhibition of the biological process and to obtain satisfactory sugars conversion level into biofuels, a detoxification step is required. This study investigates the use of two pyrochars derived from solid anaerobic digestates for the detoxification of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. At a pyrochar concentration of 40 g L-1, more than 94% of 5-HMF and 99% of furfural were removed in the synthetic medium after 24 h of contact time, whereas sugars concentration remained unchanged. Furfural was adsorbed faster than 5-HMF by both pyrochars and totally removed after 3 h of contact. Finally, the two pyrochars were found efficient in the detoxification of corn stalks and Douglas fir wood chips hydrolysates without affecting the soluble sugars concentrations.

In Togo, no study has been carried out on the sorption capacity of rock phosphate. This work will lay emphasis on the lead chemical pollutant elimination by sorption on a mineral sorbent, the rock phosphate of Togo. The physicochemical characterization of the material by techniques such as X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, pH of zero charge, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surfaces was performed. The majority phase is fluoroapatite and traces of clay minerals have been found. Its specific surface is 20.78 m(2) g(-1) and its pH(PZC) = 6.82. The batch method was used for the sorption study. Several experimentation parameters having an impact on the sorption process of the pollutant such as the pH of the solution, time of contact, the amount of sorbent and the initial concentration of the pollutant have been studied. The results of our study show that the maximum sorption capacity of lead is 166.67 mg g(-1) over the rock phosphate of Togo.

Hybrid Embedded-Systems-Based Approach to in-Driver Drunk Status Detection Using Image Processing and Sensor Networks,"['Rosero-Montalvo, PD', ' Lopez-Batista, VF', ' Peluffo-Ordonez, DH']","Car drivers under the influence of alcohol is one of the most common causes of road traffic accidents. To tackle this issue, an emerging, suitable alternative is the use of intelligent systems-traditionally based on either sensor networks or artificial vision-that are aimed to prevent starting the car when drunk status on the car driver is detected. In such vein, this paper introduces a system whose main objective is identifying a person having alcohol in the blood through supervised classification of sensor-generated and computer-vision-based data. To do so, some drunk-status criteria are considered, namely: the concentration of alcohol in the car environment, the facial temperature of the driver and the pupil width. Specifically, for data acquisition purposes, the proposed system incorporates a gas sensor, temperature sensor and a digital camera. Acquired data are analyzed into a two-stages machine learning system consisting of feature selection and supervised classification algorithms. Both acquisition and analysis stages are to be performed into a embedded system, and therefore all procedures and algorithms are designed to work at low-computational resources. As a remarkable outcome, due mainly to the incorporation of feature selection and relevance analysis stages, proposed approach reaches a classification performance of 98% while ensures adequate operation conditions for the embedded system.","['Classification algorithms', ' computer vision', ' drunk detection', ' intelligent system', ' sensors']",2021.0,IEEE SENS J,"['Engineering', ' Instruments & Instrumentation', ' Physics']",['SDAS'],False,1,False,35

The models and the ensemble mean were assessed based on the ability to reproduce the annual climatology, seasonal rainfall distribution and trend. Statistical metrics used include mean bias error, normalized root mean square error, and pattern correlation coefficient. The Taylor diagram and Taylor skill score (TSS) were used in ranking the models. The models' performance varies greatly from one season to the other. The models reproduced the observed bimodal rainfall pattern of March to May (MAM) and September to November (SON) occurring over the region. Some models slightly overestimated, while some slightly underestimated, the MAM rainfall. However, there was a high rainfall overestimation during SON by most models. The models showed a positive spatial correlation with observed dataset, whereas a low correlation was shown inter-annually. Some models could not capture the rainfall patterns around local-scale features, for example, around the Lake Victoria basin and mountainous areas. The best performing models identified in the study include GFDL-ESM4, CanESM5, CESM2-WACCM, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-LM, UKESM1-0-LL, and CNRM-CM6-1. The models CNRM-CM6-1, and CNRM-ESM2 underestimated rainfall throughout the annual cycle and mean climatology. However, these two models better reproduced the spatial trends of rainfall during both MAM and SON. Caution should be taken when employing the models in seasonal climate change studies as their performance varies from one season to another.

Structural changes resulting from the adsorption of proteins onto mineral surfaces may alter protein biological function and other environmental interactions. Iron oxides are major sinks of a range of environmental elements including organic compounds. In this study, the adsorption of the broadly studied model protein BSA onto the hematite mineral surface was characterized as a function of pH, ionic strength, and BSA concentration using in-situ Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. BSA lost the alpha-helix and gain beta-sheets in the secondary structure during adsorption on hematite. BSA adsorption was maximum at pH 5, a value close to the BSA isoelectric point (similar to pH 5), and lower at pH 4 and pH 7. Increasing ionic strength decreased to total BSA adsorption. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis of the ATR-FTIR spectra revealed that higher initial BSA concentration and the consequent higher BSA surface loading enhanced BSA adsorption by protein-protein interaction, which less ordered structures changes into more compact forms decrease, hence compacting the structural arrangement and could promoting multilayers/aggregation formation on the mineral surface.

This paper approaches these issues by assessing the reuse potential of low-sulfide mining waste rocks as aggregates for concrete regarding to the Quebec (Canada) recycling guidelines of non-hazardous inorganic wastes as construction materials. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), comprehensive physical, chemical (XRF and ICP-AES) and mineralogical investigations (XRD and SEM) as well as modern automated mineral liberation analyses have been carried out. In addition, UCS results of various concrete mixtures using different binders were then presented to illustrate the reuse potential of the waste-rocks. The TCLP test showed the nonhazardous character of the waste rocks. They contained low sulfide content (0.5 wt%), which classify them as non-acid generating and able to meet the classification in recycling category including concrete production. Moreover, liberation analyses showed that most sulfides are concentrated in the fine fraction as pyrite occurrence with a liberated fraction of only 2%.

Delayed fluorescence emission as a probe for the response of photosynthetic organisms to high temperature exposure: A comparative study,"['Oukarroum, A', ' El Gharous, M', ' Goltsev, V', ' Strasser, RJ']","The effects of a short-term exposure (40 s) to 50 degrees C on the prompt fluorescence (PF), delayed fluorescence (DF) and 820 nm reflection (MR) signals in three different photosynthetic organisms: Pisum sativum (angiosperm plant), Ginkgo biloba (gymnosperm tree) and thalli of Parmelina tiliacea (Hoffm.) Ach (lichen) were investigated. The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between prompt PF, DF and MR when the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) is destroyed. The signals of PF, DF and MR were measured simultaneously in plants in vivo to probe heat-induced damages in the photosynthetic electron transfer. PF is characterised by a polyphasic fluorescence rise OJIPSMT and DF induction curve has several maxima (I-n) and numbered in sequence according to their appearance during illumination. In control condition (25 degrees C) leaves of pea plants yield a typical OJIP rise with a flat P-step (0.2-2 s) and in G. biloba and P. tiliacea thalli, the P-level was split into two peaks, the first peak P (0.2 s) is followed by a decrease of the fluorescence intensity to a dip (S) and a subsequent rise to a second peak (M). An antiparallel relation between J-I-P-S and DF curves was also observed. Methyl viologen (MV) reduced the amplitude of the I-P phase of the PF curve and this change was accompanied by a disappearance of the PSM transient. In the presence of MV, the DF intensity remained higher; and the I-4 peak disappeared. We suggested that P-S-M rise from PF and I-4 peak might be related to an acceleration of intersystem electron transport. After 50 degrees C incubation, significant changes appeared in the PF, DF and MR transients and that were dependent on the photosynthetic sample. Heat treatment provoked a down regulation of electrons donation by the OEC in the three plant species and the re-reduction of P700(+) and PC+ started earlier and began already after 10 ms of illumination. Inhibition of the donation of electrons by OEC after 50 degrees C incubation indicates that DF induction depends on the concentrations of Q(A)(-) and P680(+) and the proton gradient. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The sand filter was filled with 50 cm of sand and 10 cm of gravel in the top and the bottom of the filter. The second step of the treatment consists of a tank (1 x 1 x 1 m(3)) filled with 20 cm of gravel and 60 cm of soil, planted with a mixture of aquatic plants at a density of 8 young plants/m(2) for each plant and irrigated twice in the week by 20L of preliminary filtered OMW.

However, efficient operation of thermochemical conversion systems requires a thorough understanding of the influence of the composition and thermal properties of these by-products on their behaviour during the conversion process. In this study, the thermal behaviour of two olive mill wastes samples (olive mill solid waste: OMSW, and concentrated olive mill wastewater: COMWW) was examined at different heating rates ranging from 5 to 50 A degrees C min(-1) in inert atmosphere using the technique of thermogravimetric analysis. As the increment of heating rates, the variations of characteristic parameters from the TG-DTG curves were determined. The initial temperature of degradation is higher in OMSW, which present a high amount of cellulose in comparison with COMWW. Three methods were used for the determination of kinetic reaction parameters: Friedman, Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and Vyazovkin methods.

"Water resources pollution associated with risks of heavy metals from Vatukoula Goldmine region, Fiji","['Kumar, S', ' Islam, AMT', ' Islam, HMT', ' Hasanuzzaman, M', ' Ongoma, V', ' Khan, R', ' Mallick, J']","Although mining is essential for human economic development, is amongst the most polluting anthropogenic sources that influence seriously in water resources. Thus, understanding the presence and concentration of heavy metals in water and sediment in the vicinity of mines is important for the sustainability of the ecosystem. In this work, a multidisciplinary approach was developed to characterize the contamination level, source apportionment, co-existence, and degree of ecological and human health risks of HMs on water resources in the Vatukoula Goldmine region (VGR), Fiji. The outcomes suggested significant contamination by Cd (range: 0.01-0.95 g/L), Pb (range: 0.03-0.53 g/L), and Mn (range: 0.01-3.66 g/L) in water samples surpassed the level set by Fiji and international laws, whereas higher concentration of Cd (range: 2.60-23.16 mg/kg), Pb (range: 28.50-200.90 mg/kg) and Zn (range: 36.50-196.66 mg/kg) were detected in sediment samples. Lead demonstrated a strong significant co-existence network with other metals (e.g., Mn, Ni). Source apportionment recognized four source patterns (Cd, Pb, Ni, and Mn) for water and (Cr, Cd-Pb, Mn, and Zn) for sediment which was further confirmed by principal component analysis. The mine inputs source mainly contributed to Cd (66.07%) for water, while mineral processing mostly contributed to Zn (76.10%) for sediment. High non-carcinogenic (>1) and carcinogenic (>10-4) health risks, particularly in children, are related to the elevated Cd, Pb and Cr contents from the VGR. Uncertainty analysis demonstrates that the 90th quantile of Cd led to higher carcinogenic risk. Pollution indices disclosed a moderate to extremely contamination status mainly along the Toko dam which poses high ecological risks identified by index calculation. However, sediment quality indicators based on probable effect levels showed that there was a 75% of likelihood that the concentrations of Cd and Pb adjacent to the VGR have a severe toxic impact on aquatic lives.","['Water and sediment pollution', ' Statistical approaches', ' Source apportionment', ' Environmental and ecological risks assessment', ' Health risks appraisal', 'POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION', ' SURFACE-WATER', ' MINING AREA', ' URBAN RIVER', ' SEDIMENTS', ' CONTAMINATION', ' DISTRICT', ' SOIL', ' INDEX', ' SUVA']",2021.0,J ENVIRON MANAGE,['Environmental Sciences & Ecology'],['King Khalid University [R.G.P.2/194/42]'],False,1,False,94
Enhanced Convolutional-Neural-Network Architecture for Crop Classification,"['Moreno-Revelo, MY', ' Guachi-Guachi, L', ' Gomez-Mendoza, JB', ' Revelo-Fuelagan, J', ' Peluffo-Ordonez, DH']","Automatic crop identification and monitoring is a key element in enhancing food production processes as well as diminishing the related environmental impact. Although several efficient deep learning techniques have emerged in the field of multispectral imagery analysis, the crop classification problem still needs more accurate solutions. This work introduces a competitive methodology for crop classification from multispectral satellite imagery mainly using an enhanced 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) designed at a smaller-scale architecture, as well as a novel post-processing step. The proposed methodology contains four steps: image stacking, patch extraction, classification model design (based on a 2D-CNN architecture), and post-processing. First, the images are stacked to increase the number of features. Second, the input images are split into patches and fed into the 2D-CNN model. Then, the 2D-CNN model is constructed within a small-scale framework, and properly trained to recognize 10 different types of crops. Finally, a post-processing step is performed in order to reduce the classification error caused by lower-spatial-resolution images. Experiments were carried over the so-named Campo Verde database, which consists of a set of satellite images captured by Landsat and Sentinel satellites from the municipality of Campo Verde, Brazil. In contrast to the maximum accuracy values reached by remarkable works reported in the literature (amounting to an overall accuracy of about 81%, a f(1) score of 75.89%, and average accuracy of 73.35%), the proposed methodology achieves a competitive overall accuracy of 81.20%, a f(1) score of 75.89%, and an average accuracy of 88.72% when classifying 10 different crops, while ensuring an adequate trade-off between the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and accuracy. Furthermore, given its ability to effectively classify patches from two image sequences, this methodology may result appealing for other real-world applications, such as the classification of urban materials.","['convolutional neural network (CNN)', ' crop classification', ' post-processing', ' satellite images', 'OBJECT RECOGNITION', ' AGRICULTURE', ' CNN', ' INFORMATION']",2021.0,APPL SCI-BASEL,"['Chemistry', ' Engineering', ' Materials Science', ' Physics']",['VIPRI'],False,1,False,60
"Unsupervised query-focused multi-document summarization based on transfer learning from sentence embedding models, BM25 model, and maximal marginal relevance criterion","['Lamsiyah, S', ' El Mahdaouy, A', ' El Alaoui, SO', ' Espinasse, B']","Extractive query-focused multi-document summarization (QF-MDS) is the process of automatically generating an informative summary from a collection of documents that answers a pre-given query. Sentence and query representation is a fundamental cornerstone that affects the effectiveness of several QF-MDS methods. Transfer learning using pre-trained word embedding models has shown promising performance in many applications. However, most of these representations do not consider the order and the semantic relationships between words in a sentence, and thus they do not carry the meaning of a full sentence. In this paper, to deal with this issue, we propose to leverage transfer learning from pre-trained sentence embedding models to represent documents' sentences and users' queries using embedding vectors that capture the semantic and the syntactic relationships between their constituents (words, phrases). Furthermore, BM25 and semantic similarity function are linearly combined to retrieve a subset of sentences based on their relevance to the query. Finally, the maximal marginal relevance criterion is applied to re-rank the selected sentences by maintaining query relevance and minimizing redundancy. The proposed method is unsupervised, simple, efficient, and requires no labeled text summarization training data. Experiments are conducted using three standard datasets from the DUC evaluation campaign (DUC'2005-2007). The overall obtained results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art systems and achieves comparable results to the best performing systems, including supervised deep learning-based methods.","['Query-focused multi-document summarization', ' Transfer learning', ' Sentence embedding models', ' BM25 model', ' Semantic similarity', ' Maximal marginal relevance']",,J AMB INTEL HUM COMP,"['Computer Science', ' Telecommunications']",[''],False,1,False,62

For this purpose, a PTC model is simulated and validated using experimental data from a PTC test loop, installed at the Green Energy Park research facility. Following, the studied system is simulated using high-quality meteorological data measured at ground level for three years. The impact of soiling on the system's heat production is studied, considering it as a time-dependent parameter. Finally, an economic analysis is conducted considering as indicators the Levelized cost of heat (LCOH) and the payback time. According to the results, the used model for PTC simulation is accurate, where the daily average deviation is around 4.8% under clear sky conditions. Furthermore, and based on the simulation results, integration of PTC in the Moroccan industrial processes can be very beneficial, where the proposed 186 kWth PTC plant can produce about 388 Tons of saturated steam at 5 bars, annually. Nevertheless, soiling is a limiting efficiency factor especially during the dry period of the year, where the solar field daily average thermal losses can reach 354 kWthh, which is equivalent to a drop of 27% in the production. Economic evaluation results showed that for a low-cost PTC (< 250 (sic)/m(2)), an LCOH and payback period of respectively 0.03 (sci)/kWthh and six years can be obtained, which makes the investment financially reliable.","['Solar heating', ' Industrial processes', ' Parabolic trough', ' Soiling', ' LCOH', ' Morocco', 'INDUSTRIAL-PROCESS HEAT', ' CONCENTRATING-SOLAR', ' POWER-GENERATION', ' DESIGN OPTIMIZATION', ' ENERGY', ' COLLECTORS', ' PERFORMANCE', ' MIRROR', ' SYSTEM', ' PV']",2019.0,SOL ENERGY,['Energy & Fuels'],[''],False,1,False,62

An experimental investigation on collapsible behavior of dry compacted phosphate mine waste rock in road embankment,"['Amrani, M', ' Taha, Y', ' Elghali, A', ' Benzaazoua, M', ' Kchikach, A', ' Hakkou, R']","Prescribing compaction at optimum water content in arid and semi-arid climate regions generally leads to unjustified ecological practices. Indeed, to achieve optimum densities for road embankment compaction, significant volumes of water are required, which is perceived as a very scarce resource in drought-prone areas. Dry compaction with the promotion of the use of materials at their natural moisture content can be a promising alternative that could save water resources. Nevertheless, dry compaction can affect the infrastructures' stability under flooding conditions. This paper presents field and laboratory tests carried out to investigate the effect of dry compaction on Phosphate Mine Waste Rocks (PMWR) behavior. In situ tests were conducted and the PMWR dry compaction protocol has been defined. Furthermore, the collapse deformation and the shear strength properties were evaluated through double oedometer and triaxial tests, respectively. The microstructural evolution on wetting was evaluated using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and 3D X-Ray computed tomography techniques. The water retention curve and mineralogical quantification tools were used to explain the influence of hydraulic hysteresis and clay minerals properties on the hydro-geotechnical behavior of PMWR. The results show a significant effect of applied stress level and dry density in addition to the type and amount of clayey expansive minerals on the structural deformation of PMWR on wetting. PMWR showed a maximum collapse settlement of 5.33% under a pressure of 1500 kPa, while no collapse is expected for stress less than 100 kPa. Low content of clays was identified as well as the swelling shrinkage potential within PMWR. The ability of using PMWR as embankment materials at dry moisture content under total overburden stress below 200 kPa ensuring a dry density of at least 95%.sigma(d)(max) is confirmed. The results of this work can also be applied to standard materials with similar hydro-geotechnical characteristics.","['Phosphate mine waste rock', ' Dry compaction', ' Laboratory and field investigations', ' Collapse-swelling potential', ' Microstructural study', ' Hydraulic hysteresis', 'SOILS']",2021.0,TRANSP GEOTECH,['Engineering'],['RD'],False,1,False,54

Design and Analysis of Commercially Viable Free-Space Optical Communication Link for Diverse Beam Divergence Profiles,"['Singh, H', ' Miglani, R', ' Mittal, N', ' Gaba, GS', ' Masud, M', ' Aljahdali, S']","With an exponential increase in the use of smart devices and with increasing demand for high-speed data applications, the Radio Frequency and Microwave links will find themselves almost incapable of meeting this deficit. Free-space optical (FSO) links are poised to take the leading role as communication systems for futuristic needs in providing cost-effective and high-speed connectivity to end-users. However, on the flip side, the reliability of FSO links has an intrinsic relationship with the characteristics of the atmospheric channel. During the propagation, the atmospheric adversities result in the geometrical spreading of the FSO beam which in turn has consequential degrading effects on the link performance. In this work, an FSO communication system based on practical, commercial, and realistic parameters has been proposed with the intent of accurately determining the co-relation between different beam divergence profiles and overall link performance. For different beam divergence profiles, the proposed link has been evaluated for reference bit error rate (BER) of 10(-9) which is an ideal condition for delivering high-speed data access to the end-users. During the analysis, the practical constraints related to the trade-off between the maximum possible link range and beam divergence have also been optimized. The findings of this work will be crucial for engineers and designers in configuring FSO links for improved link range and reliability.","['BER (bit error rate)', ' SNR (signal noise ratio)', ' link range', ' beam divergence', ' commercial FSO system', ' received power', 'WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS', ' SYSTEMS', ' FSO', ' TECHNOLOGIES', ' TRANSMISSION', ' CHALLENGES', ' IOT']",2021.0,FRONT PHYS-LAUSANNE,['Physics'],['TURSP'],False,1,False,41
Identifying maize yield and precipitation gaps in Uganda,"['Epule, TE', ' Dhiba, D', ' Etongo, D', ' Peng, CH', ' Lepage, L']","In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), precipitation is an important driver of agricultural production. In Uganda, maize production is essentially rain-fed. However, due to changes in climate, projected maize yield targets have not often been met as actual observed maize yields are often below simulated/projected yields. This outcome has often been attributed to parallel gaps in precipitation. This study aims at identifying maize yield and precipitation gaps in Uganda for the period 1998-2017. Time series historical actual observed maize yield data (hg/ha/year) for the period 1998-2017 were collected from FAOSTAT. Actual observed maize growing season precipitation data were also collected from the climate portal of World Bank Group for the period 1998-2017. The simulated or projected maize yield data and the simulated or projected growing season precipitation data were simulated using a simple linear regression approach. The actual maize yield and actual growing season precipitation data were now compared with the simulated maize yield data and simulated growing season precipitation to establish the yield gaps. The results show that three key periods of maize yield gaps were observed (period one: 1998, period two: 2004-2007 and period three: 2015-2017) with parallel precipitation gaps. However, in the entire series (1998-2017), the years 2008-2009 had no yield gaps yet, precipitation gaps were observed. This implies that precipitation is not the only driver of maize yields in Uganda. In fact, this is supported by a low correlation between precipitation gaps and maize yield gaps of about 6.3%. For a better understanding of cropping systems in SSA, other potential drivers of maize yield gaps in Uganda such as soils, farm inputs, crop pests and diseases, high yielding varieties, literacy, and poverty levels should be considered.

Herein, the principal objective of this work is to investigate the corrosion inhibition effect of novel 1,2,3-triazolyl nucleosides namely, 2-(acetoxymethyl)-5-(3-((1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diyl diacetate (TBAc) and 2-(acetoxymethyl)-5-(3-((1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diyl diacetate (TNAc) for mild steel (MS) in HCl solution.

Further, we have examined the effect of iodide ions on inhibition efficiency, and the obtained data were compared and discussed. Results showed that these green compounds exhibited high inhibition performances thanks to their excellent molecular and electronic properties. They indicated that TNAc and TBAc showed high corrosion inhibition efficiencies at 5x10(-3) mol/L with 0.1 mmol/L of KI. The inhibition efficiency of TNAc and TBAc reached 85% and 79% at 5x10(-3) mol/L, while it improved to 94% and 91% in the presence of KI, respectively. Electrochemical tests revealed that the studied molecules acted as mixed-type inhibitors and they had a significant effect on the polarization resistance of mild steel. Moreover, the surface morphology analysis was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and XPS. Besides, a systematic understanding of how these molecules are adsorbed on steel surface was theoretically investigated. Taken together, experimental and theoretical results suggested a significant role of molecular properties of studied derivatives along with intermediate species in promoting their adsorption behavior.

The deposit displays two ore facies, the black and the brown ores, which are stacked obliquely and show internal layering with swaley cross-stratification and large-scale high-angle cross-bedding. To investigate the phosphorite depositional and hydrodynamic settings, grain size analysis and sequential Gaussian simulation of P2O5 contents from 29 drill holes were performed. Results of grain size analysis reveal that a marine flooding event associated with the Thanetian transgression involved the transport and reworking of phosphatic materials by paleocurrents in a medium-energy environment and their disposition as a shoreface deposit. The simulation indicates the disposition of the phosphorite formation in at least three superimposed bodies elongated N63 degrees, parallel to the Ain Fouris shoal. These results are consistent with morphodynamic responses to sedimentological and oceanographic processes involving the interaction of paleocurrents with substrate morphology. The black ore facies has preserved features of the pristine phosphate indicating that the deposit was not significantly displaced away from the phosphogenesis zone.

Impact of drought and temperature constraints on development and growth of faba bean (Vicia faba L.),"['Kibbou, F', ' El Bouhmadi, K', ' Marrou, H', ' Sinclair, TR', ' Ghanem, ME']","Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is an important traditional pulse crop in many parts of Asia and the Mediterranean region. However, water deficit and temperature, two of the key variables associated with climate variability, can have major negative influences on the development and growth of faba bean. A series of experiments were conducted to study the potential impact of temperature and water deficit on several physiological processes among faba bean genotypes. Development of node number was determined to be dependent on temperature and was found to be essentially constant among genotypes with a value of 56 degrees C accumulated temperature required for appearance of each node. Plant leaf area, which is important in crop carbon accumulation, was estimated by developing allometric relationships between plant leaf area and number of nodes. The coefficients of these relationships varied among genotypes. Water deficit was found to be critical in impacting plant transpiration and nitrogen fixation rates. The threshold for the decrease in transpiration rate with soil drying was found to range from a fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) from 0.22 to 0.60 among 12 genotypes, indicating a genetic resource for improving drought resilience. Results in comparing symbiotic nitrogen fixation on drying soil among genotypes also indicated genetic variation, with one genotype (WW4403/H) being especially drought tolerant. The results of these experiments identified important genotypic differences in sensitivity of specific physiological processes to temperature and water deficit, which can be exploited to improve faba bean resilience to these environmental variables.","['Drought', ' leaf area', ' leaf development', ' nitrogen fixation', ' soil drying', ' transpiration']",2022.0,J CROP IMPROV,"['Agriculture', ' Plant Sciences']",[''],False,1,False,23
Alkali-Hydrothermal Treatment of K-Rich Igneous Rocks for Their Direct Use as Potassic Fertilizers,"['Mbissik, A', ' Elghali, A', ' Ouabid, M', ' Raji, O', ' Bodinier, JL', ' El Messbahi, H']","Due to the increasing demand for conventional sources of potassium (K) and their inaccessibility by African countries, K-rich igneous rocks are increasingly studied as potential alternative sources. In this study, six potassic igneous rocks (syenites and trachytes) from the Tamazeght, Jbel Boho, Ait Saoun, and El Glo'a regions (Morocco) were sampled and characterized. Then they were hydrothermally treated to enhance their K release for potential use as potassic fertilizers. The raw materials are mainly formed by microcline (up to 74%), orthoclase (20-68%), albite (36-57%), biotite-muscovite (15-23%), and titanite, calcite, hematite, and apatite as accessory minerals. These samples were crushed and milled to reach a particle size <150 mu m and mixed with 4 N NaOH solution in an autoclave. The liquid/solid (L/S) ratio was about 44 mL/50 g. The powders were allowed to react with the solution at 170 degrees C for 7 h. For all tests, NaOH reacted completely with the powders and no liquid was observed after the treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared spectroscopy (IRTF), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) were carried out on treated samples to characterize the mineralogical and structural changes due to the alkali-hydrothermal treatment. Indeed, the treated samples revealed the presence of sodic neoformed phases such as thermonatrite, sodalite, analcime, and cancrinite. The treated material was leached for a week using deionized water and the elements released were measured using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The hydrothermal process showed a strong effect on structure breakdown as well as on the release of K and other nutrients such as P, Fe, Si, Mg, and Ca. Therefore, the alkali-hydrothermal treatment allowed the release of 50.5 wt% K. Moreover, the release of Mg, Ca, Fe, P, K, and Si were significantly increased. Mg, Ca, Fe, P, K, and Si release within raw materials was about (0.5-3.6), (3.5-31.4), (0.01-0.4), (0.01-0.3), (20-55), and (4.6-8) mg/kg, respectively, whereas treated samples showed a higher release of these elements. Quantitatively, Mg, Ca, Fe, P, K, and Si releases were about (10-11.8), (60-70), (7-20), (1.2-15), (218-1278), and (1119-2759) mg/kg, respectively. Consequently, the treated igneous rocks (syenite and trachyte) could be directly used as potassic fertilizers that would also be a source of other nutrients.","['potassic igneous rocks', ' alkali-hydrothermal treatment', ' K-fertilizer', ' potassium release']",2021.0,MINERALS-BASEL,"['Geochemistry & Geophysics', ' Mineralogy', ' Mining & Mineral Processing']",['OCP'],True,1,False,97
Borders as opportunities in the space-economy: towards a theory of enabling space,"['Nijkamp, P']","This paper posits that regional science-as a multidisciplinary analysis of the functioning of regions-has, in its historical evolution, largely neglected the specific role of borders. Borders do not only act as barriers with friction costs in an otherwise open human interaction space; they are multidimensional organizing principles for mobility, interaction, location, and socio-cultural identities of areas. The existence of borders does therefore not necessarily mean exclusively the existence of costly impedance and transaction frictions. Starting from a historical sketch of focal points in regional science, the paper seeks to develop the contours of a new conceptualisation of enabling space in which borders may be seen as opportunities for innovative development in a cross-border space-economy. Amartya Sen's capability theory will be used as a cornerstone for a novel interpretation of borders to be used by smart and alert actors as a challenging and promising portfolio of cooperative development strategies for people, business agents, and spatial cohesion policy.

Partition of Unity Finite Element Analysis of Nonlinear Transient Diffusion Problems Using p -Version Re finement,"['El Kahoui, A', ' Malek, M', ' Izem, N', ' Mohamed, MS', ' Seaid, M']","We propose a high -order enriched partition of unity finite element method for linear and nonlinear time -dependent diffusion problems. The solution of this class of problems often exhibits non -smooth features such as steep gradi- ents and boundary layers which can be very challenging to recover using the con- ventional low -order finite element methods. A class of steady-state exponential functions has been widely used for enrichment and its performance to numerically solve these challenges has been demonstrated. However, these enrichment func- tions have been used only in context of the standard h -version refinement or the so-called q -version refinement. In this paper we demonstrate that the p -version refinement can also be a very attractive option in terms of the efficiency and the accuracy in the enriched partition of unity finite element method. First, the tran- sient diffusion problem is integrated in time using a semi -implicit scheme and the semi -discrete problem is then integrated in space using the p -version enriched finite elements. Numerical results are presented for three test examples of time - dependent diffusion problems in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. The computed results show the significant improvement when using the p -version refined enriched approximations in the finite element analysis. In addition, these results support our expectations for a robust and high -order accurate enriched par- tition of unity finite element method.","['Partition of unity', ' finite element method', ' p-version refinement', ' enrichment functions', ' nonlinear diffusion problems', 'ENRICHMENT']",2020.0,CMES-COMP MODEL ENG,"['Engineering', ' Mathematics']",['ERC'],False,1,False,24

Short term solar irradiance forecasting using sky images based on a hybrid CNN-MLP model,"['El Alani, O', ' Abraim, M', ' Ghennioui, H', ' Ghennioui, A', ' Ikenbi, I', ' Dahr, FE']","High penetration of photovoltaics (PV) has been observed in the energy market over the last decade. However, its integration into electrical grids is challenging, as solar energy is highly fluctuating given its dependence on different weather variables. Consequently, short-term forecasting of solar irradiance provides a pivotal solution to ensure optimal use of the produced energy and reduce its uncertainty. This study proposes a hybrid convolutional neural network and Multilayer perceptron (CNN-MLP) model to forecast the global irradiance 15 min ahead. The model uses images from a hemispherical sky imager, time series of GHI, and weather variables collected from a ground meteorological station in Morocco. The evaluation of the proposed model under clear, mixed, and overcast days shows that the proposed model performs better than the persistence model. The root mean square error (RMSE) varies between 13.05 W/m(2) and 49.16 W/m(2) for CNN-MLP and between 45.76 W/m(2) and 114.19 W/m(2) for persistence. The coefficient of determination (R-2) varies between 0.99 and 0.94 for the MLP-CNN and between 0.98 and 0.79 for persistence.

Bioformulation of Silk-Based Coating to Preserve and Deliver Rhizobium tropici to Phaseolus vulgaris Under Saline Environments,"['Mhada, M', ' Zvinavashe, AT', ' Hazzoumi, Z', ' Zeroual, Y', ' Marelli, B', ' Kouisni, L']","Seed priming has been for a long time an efficient application method of biofertilizers and biocontrol agents. Due to the quick degradation of the priming agents, this technique has been limited to specific immediate uses. With the increase of awareness of the importance of sustainable use of biofertilizers, seed coating has presented a competitive advantage regarding its ability to adhere easily to the seed, preserve the inoculant, and decompose in the soil. This study compared primed Phaseolus vulgaris seeds with Rhizobium tropici and trehalose with coated seeds using a silk solution mixed with R. tropici and trehalose. We represented the effect of priming and seed coating on seed germination and the development of seedlings by evaluating physiological and morphological parameters under different salinity levels (0, 20, 50, and 75 mM). Results showed that germination and morphological parameters have been significantly enhanced by applying R. tropici and trehalose. Seedlings of coated seeds show higher root density than the freshly primed seeds and the control. The physiological response has been evaluated through the stomatal conductance, the chlorophyll content, and the total phenolic compounds. The stability of these physiological traits indicated the role of trehalose in the protection of the photosystems of the plant under low and medium salinity levels. R. tropici and trehalose helped the plant mitigate the negative impact of salt stress on all traits. These findings represent an essential contribution to our understanding of stress responses in coated and primed seeds. This knowledge is essential to the design of coating materials optimized for stressed environments. However, further progress in this area of research must anticipate the development of coatings adapted to different stresses using micro and macro elements, bacteria, and fungi with a significant focus on biopolymers for sustainable agriculture and soil microbiome preservation.","['biomaterial in agriculture', ' sustainable agriculture', ' food security', ' soil salinity', ' seed coating', 'TREHALOSE BIOSYNTHESIS', ' STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE', ' SALT STRESS', ' METABOLISM', ' SYNTHASE', ' GROWTH', ' L.', ' OSMOPROTECTANTS', ' TOLERANCE', ' YIELD']",2021.0,FRONT PLANT SCI,['Plant Sciences'],"['OCP', 'MIT']",True,2,False,48

The physical, chemical and mineralogical characterization of the starting clayey material will improve understanding of the thermal shocks resistance character of Mzouda tajine. The physical properties of raw materials were identified by particle size distribution and consistency limits. Chemical composition was evaluated through XRF, total organic content and calcimetry, while mineralogical characteristics were investigated by the XRD technique. Two common raw clay materials used for Tajine's manufacturing in Morocco were chosen as references. Results showed that the main oxides in the studied samples were SiO2 and Al2O3, whereas the other oxides were present only in small quantities. Quartz, feldspars and clay minerals were the dominant mineral phases, associated with minor phases of dolomite and hematite. Illite was the dominant phase among the clay minerals, followed by smectite, while kaolinite, chlorite and vermiculite may also be present in small abundance. Compared to the reference clays, the clay mixture adopted by the potters is adequate in terms of mineralogy and chemistry to produce Tajines. In terms of plasticity, the clay mixture used is suitable for moulding owing to its moderate plasticity parameters.

The implementation of the proposed semi-Lagrangian finite volume method differs from its Eulerian counterpart in the fact that the present method is applied at each time step along the characteristic curves rather than in the time direction. To ensure conservation of mass at each time step, we adopt the adjusted advection techniques for unstructured triangular grids. The focus is on constructing efficient solvers with large stability regions and fully conservative to solve convection-dominated flow problems.

Efficient forwarding strategy in HDRP protocol based Internet of Things,"['Tekouabou, SCK', ' Alaoui, EA', ' Gallais, A']","The Internet of Things (IoT) includes a variety of heterogeneous wireless network technologies such as Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and all kinds of smart devices connected over a wireless network.

DTN has emerged as a promising new network paradigm that aims to cope with the increasing number of heterogeneous networks and the need for efficient and robust data dissemination to be more stable. But one of the hindering bottlenecks the full applicability of such a DTN-based approach to the IoT, is that forwarding data in an environment could lose when the connection between nodes is intermittent.

Furthermore, the thermal stability of samples was studied by measuring the mechanical properties after exposure to several cycles of heat treatment at different elevated temperatures (350, 500, 650 and 800 degrees C). The obtained results showed that the structure of phosphate sludge underwent a significant variation after fusion. Alkali thermal treatment led mainly to the decomposition of illite, palygorskite and dolomite, and the formation of Na-rich crystalline phases. NaOH content as well as temperature of fusion has been proved to be essential factors controlling the transformations of the material structure and hence the development of the geopolymer strength.

Among those contaminants, standout gallic acid which is known for its high toxicity even at low concentration. In this work, we investigated the application of Ni-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as adsorbents in the removal of gallic acid from synthetic aqueous solutions. The solids were synthesised by co-precipitation method with a cationic ratio of 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), surface area measurement (N-2 adsorption/desorption) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods were used to characterise the adsorbents.

The adsorption experiments results showed that the pseudo-second-order model was the better kinetic model to describe the gallic acid remove. The equilibrium adsorption data were analysed using the Freundlich, Langmuir, Sips and Toth isotherm equation models. For both fresh and calcined Ni-Al-LDH, the adsorption equilibrium followed the Freundlich model. The process was endothermic, being the maximum adsorption capacities of 137.9 and 82.97 mg/g for fresh and calcined Ni-Al-LDH, respectively. The findings showed more than 94% of the gallic acid could be removed by Ni-Al-LDH calcined at 500 degrees C.

Numerical solution of Rosseland model for transient thermal radiation in non-grey optically thick media using enriched basis functions,"['Malek, M', ' Izem, N', ' Mohamed, MS', ' Seaid, M', ' Wakrim, M']","Heat radiation in optically thick non-grey media can be well approximated with the Rosseland model which is a class of nonlinear diffusion equations with convective boundary conditions. The optical spectrum is divided into a set of finite bands with constant absorption coefficients but with variable Planckian diffusion coefficients. This simplification reduces the computational costs significantly compared to solving a full radiative heat transfer model. Therefore, the model is very popular for industrial and engineering applications. However, the opaque nature of the media often results in thermal boundary layers that requires highly refined meshes, to be recovered numerically. Such meshes can significantly hinder the performance of numerical methods. In this work we explore for the first time using enriched basis functions for the model in order to avoid using refined meshes. In particular, we discuss the finite element method when using basis functions enriched with a combination of exponential and hyperbolic functions. We show that the enrichment can resolve thermal boundary layers on coarse meshes and with few elements. Comparisons to the standard finite element method for thermal radiation in non-grey optically thick media with multi-frequency bands show the efficiency of the approach. Although we mainly study the enriched basis functions in glass cooling applications the substantial saving in the computational requirements makes the approach highly relevant to a large number of engineering applications that involve solving the Rosseland model.

The REE tested in this study include some of the most prominent representatives, such as europium (Eu), samarium (Sm) and neodymium (Nd). Within the experiments, a fast decrease of the REE3+ concentration in solution was tracked by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). It revealed an almost complete (>99%) biosorption of REE3+ within the first hour after the addition of metal salts. REE3+ uptake by biomass was checked using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and showed that all three selected REE3+ species were enriched in the cyanobacterial biomass and the process is assigned to a biosorption process. Although the biomass stayed alive during the experiments, up to that, a distinction whether the REE3+ was intra- or extracellularly sorbed was not possible, since biosorption is a metabolism independent process which occurs on living as well as non-living biomass. For europium it was shown by TEM that electron dense particles, presumably europium particles with particle sizes of about 15 nm, are located inside the vegetative cyanobacterial cells. This gave clear evidence that Eu3+ was actively sorbed by living cyanobacteria. Eu3+ biosorption by cell wall precipitation due to interaction with extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) could therefore be excluded.

The toxicity of accumulated Cd was determined by the change of cellular and photosynthetic parameters. Obtained results showed that the maximum capacity of Cd accumulation in algal biomass was reached for both strains at 24 h of exposure to 600 mu M of Cd. Under this condition, C. reinhardtii showed a higher uptake of Cd compared to the strain CPCC 121, inducing a stronger cellular toxic impact. Chlamydomonas CPCC 121 showed a tolerance for Cd due to the exclusion of Cd at the cell wall surface, which was higher at pH 4 than pH 7.

The Essaouira region at the edge of the Moroccan Atlantic Ocean is subject to a semi-arid climate. The decrease in rainfall as a result of climate change and the increase in the exploitation of surface and groundwater have disrupted the stability of these resources and threaten the socio-economic and environmental balance in the area under investigation. Climate scenarios estimate that precipitation will decrease by 10-20% while warming increases by 3 degrees C over the next 30 years. The physico-chemical parameters studied show that the evolution of the pH and temperature of the groundwater remained stable with a neutral (pH approximate to 7) and a hypothermal character (T < 30 degrees C). For the electrical conductivity, it showed an increasing trend from 2017 to 2020. A hydrochemical approach showed that the groundwater mineralization was controlled by the dissolution of evaporites and carbonates, by cation exchange processes, and by seawater contamination. A groundwater assessment for drinking use was made by comparing the concentrations of the chemical elements with the standards set by the World Health Organization. The results obtained show that the groundwater from the aquifers studied requires treatment before being consumed, in particular for Cl- and SO42-. Furthermore, the groundwater quality for irrigation was evaluated based on the parameters Na% and Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR). The results showed that the groundwater was adequate for agricultural purposes, especially for the plants that adapt to high salinity. The monitoring of surface water by processing the satellite images via the calculation of the normalized difference water index (NDWI) showed an increase in water surface areas in the region following the commissioning of two large dams (Zerrar and Igouzoullene). Despite the installation of these hydraulic structures, a drop of 4.85 km(2) in water surface area was observed beyond 2016. This situation requires intervention in order to preserve this vital resource.","['groundwater', ' NDWI', ' water surface', ' semi-arid area', ' GIS']",2021.0,WATER-SUI,"['Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Water Resources']",[''],False,1,False,33

Due to intense urbanization in the world, pollutants such as trace elements (FE) or pathogenic microorganisms are continually emitted into the environment and pose a threat to ecosystems. The aim of this work was to assess the soil quality of PGS in the cities of Marrakech (Morocco) and Torun (Poland) through physicochemical and microbiological approaches and to assess related health risks. Eighteen soils from the most visited historic parks in Marrakech and Torun were sampled and analyzed. The results showed that content of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in Torun urban soils is about three times higher than that measured in Marrakech urban park soils. These differences are related to the naturally higher content of organic matter in the soils of temperate climate regions than in Mediterranean soils. The concentrations of trace element (FE) showed a similar trend in both cities, except for Pb in one Marrakech site, which exhibited a high concentration (400 mg Pb Kg(-1) in Bab Rab Park). Soil enzymes present a high sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances and can be used as tool to evaluate early disturbance of urban soils. The alkaline phosphatase (APHa) and urease (URa) activities are less affected by anthropogenic pressure than dehydrogenase (DHa). Slight sensitivity to TE was observed in the microbial community in the order fungi < actinomycetes < bacteria. Total and fecal coliforms (TC, FC) were present in all soil samples, with higher concentrations in Marrakech sites. Based on estimated FC risk, the highest percentage did not exceed 11% of the guideline limit set by International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods.

The glasses exhibit a yellow to dark color with the increase in manganese content owing to the presence of Mn(2+)and Mn(3+)ions in the network. The amorphous state of the glasses is evidenced by the X-ray diffraction. In order to get an insight into the physical and structural aspects of these vitreous materials, we have determined some of their parameters such as density, molar volume and glass transition temperature. From differential thermal analysis scan on heating, we evaluated the glass transition temperature (T-g) of each glass, which corresponds to the phase transition temperature from solid to viscous liquid. The density (rho) as a structural index is found to increase while the corresponding molar volume decreases with MnO(2)content. The structural approach of the studied glasses is evaluated by infrared (IR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. IR technique allowed us to identify the coexisting bond vibration modes in the glass network, and it has shown that many structural phosphates units coexist, mainly pyrophosphate and metaphosphate structural groups. EPR experiments have shown the presence of Mn(2+)centers in the glasses. The UV-Visible absorption is utilized to estimate the values of the optical band gap (E-g) and Urbach energy (Delta E). The optical band gap energy is determined from both the absorption spectrum fitting (ASF) and Tauc's methods. These optical parameters are composition dependence. The dc conductivity of the glasses is determined in the temperature range from 303 to 473 K. It decreases with increasing manganese content. It is thermally activated and followed an Arrhenius behavior.

Considered as mining wastes intimately mixed with other silicated and carbonated lithologies, they are stored as coarse waste rocks in large dumps nearby the phosphate mines; as it is the case of Gantour mine of OCP group (Morocco). These clay occurrences have been investigated as a raw material for the production of ceramics, especially fired clay bricks. In this paper, pressed and fired briquettes made of the isolated clayey lithology were manufactured. The clay material mineralogy include dolomite, quartz, palygorskite, and montmorillonite. The as-formed briquettes were oven dried at 105 degrees C then fired in the range 900-1100 degrees C. Both raw and sintered samples (at various temperature) were investigated by differential thermal and thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical and scanning electron microscope (OM-SEM) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR). Main physical and mechanical properties were assessed and correlated to the microstructural changes. The obtained results revealed that sintering temperature increase led to dehydroxylation of clay minerals, persistence of quartz and neo-formation of diopside, anorthite, hematite and magnetite. SEM secondary electron images showed bricks vitrification together with micro-porosity formation during firing, which greatly influenced the mechanical properties. The elaborated bricks displayed acceptable water absorption capacity and firing shrinkage rate with good flexural strength, showing that they could be used in the bricks manufacturing.

To mitigate the effects of agricultural activities and enhance water quality, this study considered the impact of different best management practices (BMPs) in agriculture. The objective of the research was to evaluate the impacts of various agricultural BMPs on nitrate losses in the Sebdou catchment in north-west Africa using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in order to identify and recommend the most appropriate BMP. The study was carried out in two parts: first, the SWAT model was calibrated and validated to simulate discharge and nitrate losses at the outlet of the catchment, and second, the calibrated model was used to assess the effects of BMPs on nitrate losses. The hydrological modelling fitted well with the observed data for the calibration and validation periods (NSE between 0.63 and 0.65 and R-2 between 0.80 and 0.92). Nitrate simulation was also satisfactory (NSE = 0.58 and R-2 = 0.58), with the average nitrate exports at the outlet varying between 136 and 149 t N year(-1). Agricultural tillage practices were the main N input and plant uptake was the main N output. The simulation results of BMP scenarios (contour farming, strip cropping and terracing) showed a significant decrease in nitrate quantity in soil, nitrate yield in surface run-off and nitrate exports. The maximum reduction was observed from the use of parallel terraces, which reduced nitrate in soil by 17% (41 kg ha(-1)) and decreased nitrate flux exportation to below 133 t N year(-1) (a reduction of about 11%).

The UV?Visible spectra of the CoO-doped glasses show visible absorption bands in the region 400?700 nm which are related to the coexistence of cobalt in divalent and trivalent states. The crystallization behaviour of the samples is performed by submitting the glasses to controlled heat treatments and the crystalline phases obtained are identified by X-Ray diffraction (XRD). The kinetic of the crystallization is carried out by employing the thermal analysis (DSC) technique. The crystallization process is discussed regarding the obtained activation energy (Ec) and Avrami parameter (n). The Vickers hardness values of the glasses and the glass-ceramics are determined and discussed according to the bond strengths. The electrical conductivity of these materials is investigated over a large frequency domain at various temperatures. It is found that the electric conductivity decreases with increasing cobalt content. It is also noted that the conductivity of each glass-ceramic is reduced in comparison with that of its mother glass. The frequency-dependent of the conductivity follows Jonscher?s power law and the correlated barrier hopping mechanisms (CBH) was appropriate for the conduction process inside the glasses. The electrical modulus formalism is applied to the electric data in order to study their dielectric relaxation. The results show that this latter is non-Debye type in agreement with the well-known universal responses of amorphous materials.","['Phosphate', ' Glasses', ' Structure', ' UV?Visible', ' Electric conductivity', ' Crystallization', 'ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES', ' LEAD PHOSPHATE', ' CONDUCTIVITY', ' BEHAVIOR', ' IONS']",2021.0,PHYSICA B,['Physics'],"['CNRST', 'OCP']",True,2,False,36
Green waste composting under GORE((R)) cover membrane at industrial scale: physico-chemical properties and spectroscopic assessment,"['Al-Alawi, M', ' Szegi, T', ' El Fels, L', ' Hafidi, M', ' Simon, B', ' Gulyas, M']","Purpose Green waste (GW) composting is of increasing importance to the waste management industry in addition being a useful agricultural product that is rich in nutrient and organic matter (OM). The combination of aerated static windrow with GORE((R)) cover membrane and an air-floor aeration system is a relatively new industrial-scale composting technology that has not been previously explored. Therefore, the aim of this research study was to evaluate the effectiveness of composting GW using this new technology. Methods The composting process was monitored through changes in the physico-chemical properties, E-4/6, and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Results Disinfection requirements were met by holding composting temperature steady in the thermophilic range for 24 days. The technology greatly improved composting conditions, and final compost product in terms of temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), C/N ratio, OM degradation, nitrogen transformation, humification, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The FTIR spectra revealed that there was enrichment of aromatic compounds and reduction in aliphatic structures and easily assimilated peptide components by microorganisms, indicating the humification degree increased, the final compost stabilized, and confirming the efficiency of composting. Consequently, the new technology produced a mature compost in only 30 days compared with the standard period of 90-270 days for traditional composting. Conclusion Notably, the new technology may be a sustainable alternative for GW management that converts waste into compost and could be beneficial for agricultural uses.","['Green waste', ' Physico-chemical properties', ' Composting', ' GORE((R)) cover membrane', ' FTIR spectroscopy', 'CATION-EXCHANGE CAPACITY', ' ORGANIC-MATTER TRANSFORMATIONS', ' SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE', ' FISH POND SEDIMENT', ' SEWAGE-SLUDGE', ' PIG MANURE', ' STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION', ' MICROBIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES', ' QUALITY ASSESSMENT', ' FTIR SPECTROSCOPY']",2019.0,INT J RECYCLING ORG,['Environmental Sciences & Ecology'],"['Stipendium Hungaricum Scholarship', ' Tempus Public Foundation']",False,2,False,95

Gluten free flour made of pulses is known to enhance the nutritional quality of wheat flour. However, its addition can compromise the rheological and sensorial attributes of the bread. We used mixture design to optimize nutritional and technological qualities of a wheat-chickpea flour blend by adding milk powder as a natural organoleptic improver. A total of thirteen flour blends were prepared by incorporating 10 to 30% chickpea flour and 10 to 20% milk powder to wheat flour. Our results showed that the optimal flour blend consisted of 60% wheat, 24% chickpea, and 16% milk powder. Farinographic parameters of the optimal dough blend remained on par with those of the control dough (100% wheat flour), thereby preserving its bread-making quality. Sensory analysis of breads made from the optimal flour blend revealed no significant difference (p <= 0.05) from wheat flour for crumb and chewiness. Appreciation was brought to the appearance, crust, aroma, and taste in the optimized bread. This study suggests that chickpea flour can be suitably incorporated into bread wheat flour up to a percentage of 24% with 16% milk powder to produce bread with optimal nutritional quality while improving its sensory attributes and consumer acceptability.","['flat bread', ' mixture design', ' chickpea', ' milk powder', ' nutritional fortification', ' organoleptic enhancement', 'CICER-ARIETINUM L.', ' GLUTEN-FREE', ' MIXTURE DESIGN', ' DOUGH RHEOLOGY', ' LEGUME FLOURS', ' QUALITY', ' HEALTH', ' FOOD', ' FORMULATION', ' FRACTIONS']",2021.0,FOODS,['Food Science & Technology'],"['AFESD', 'CGIAR']",False,2,False,59

It was, recently, demonstrated that there are no risks in terms of contamination of essential oil (EO) from growing plant on such land. Interest in exploring the antibacterial and antioxidant potential of A. semibaccata EO has consequently been renewed. The objective of this study was to investigate the chemical composition, as well as the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of A. semibaccata EO. The antibacterial activity was evaluated against native (drug-sensitive) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria by testing the EO alone and in combination with conventional antibiotics. The chemical composition of EO was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, 52 chemical compounds were identified, and 2-Methoxy-4-vinyl phenol (48.9%), benzaldehyde (6.7%), and benzyl alcohol (6.3%) were found to be the main constituents of EO. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity was evaluated using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl reducing-scavenging test. The EO from this species possessed high antioxidant activity (938.65 mu g TE/g EO). The antibacterial test demonstrated an inhibitory effect on six native and MDR bacterial strains. We found that Staphylococcus aureus (Gram+), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Gram-), and Escherichia coli (Gram-) were more sensitive than MDR strains, with an inhibition zone ranging from 11.16 mm to 12 mm. Moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 3.12 mg/mL to 6.25 mg/mL. The combination of gentamicin and EO revealed a high synergistic effect. The effect on S. aureus and K. pneumoniae showed lower fractional inhibitory concentration indices of 0.39 and 0.27, respectively. The results also revealed that A. semibaccata EO contained compounds with antibacterial potential against MDR bacteria, with antioxidant properties, and with a moderate synergistic effect in combination with gentamicin. The EO from A. semibaccata could be considered a new and potential source of natural antioxidant and antibacterial agents. These findings make A. semibaccata an excellent choice for the revegetation of marginal lands with the subsequent use of biomass for the production of EO with significant potential in the control of microbial infection.","['Atriplex semibaccata', ' essential oil', ' antibacterial', ' antioxidant', ' multidrug-resistant bacteria', ' marginal lands', ' phosphate mine waste', 'IN-VITRO ACTIVITY', ' STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS', ' ANTIBIOTICS', ' L.', ' 2-METHOXY-4-VINYLPHENOL', ' FLAVONOIDS', ' FRACTIONS', ' TOLERANCE', ' MEDICINE', ' PRODUCTS']",2021.0,AGRONOMY-BASEL,"['Agriculture', ' Plant Sciences']","['MESRSFC', 'CNRST']",False,2,False,66
Enhanced conformal perfectly matched layers for Bernstein-Bezier finite element modelling of short wave scattering,"['El Kacimi, A', ' Laghrouche, O', ' Ouazar, D', ' Mohamed, MS', ' Seaid, M', ' Trevelyan, J']","The aim of this paper is to accurately solve short wave scattering problems governed by the Helmholtz equation using the Bernstein-Bezier Finite Element method (BBFEM), combined with a conformal perfectly matched layer (PML). Enhanced PMLs, where curved geometries are represented by means of the blending map method of Gordon and Hall, are numerically investigated. In particular, the performance of radial and elliptical shaped PMLs, with a parabolic absorption function, are assessed and compared in terms of accuracy against second order Bayliss-Gunzberger-Turkel (BGT(2)) based local absorbing boundary conditions. Numerical results dealing with problems of Hankel source radiation and wave scattering by a rigid cylinder show that the radial shaped PML, with the h and p versions of BBFEM, enables the recovery of the predicted algebraic and exponential convergence rates of a high order finite element method (FEM). Furthermore, radial shaped BGT(2) and PML have a similar performance, as long as the wave is not sufficiently well resolved. But, BGT(2) performs poorly as the wave resolution increases. Additionally, the effect of harmonics of higher modes on accuracy is examined. The study reveals that the PML outperforms BGT(2) for almost all propagating modes. However, a similar performance is achieved with both methods either with higher modes or a low wave resolution. Results from a multiple scattering benchmark problem provide evidence of the good performance of the proposed PMLs and the benefit of elliptical shaped PMLs in reducing significantly the size of the computational domain, without altering accuracy. The choice of the PML parameters ensuring optimal performance is also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The montmorillonite clay was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyses, and zero point charge in order to establish the adsorption behavior-properties relationship. The physiochemical parameters like pH, initial PNP concentration, and adsorbent dose as well as their binary interaction effects on the PNP adsorption yield were statistically optimized using response surface methodology. As a result, 99.5% removal of PNP was obtained under the optimal conditions of pH 2, adsorbent dose of 2 g/l, and PNP concentration of 20 mg/l. The interaction between adsorbent dose and initial concentration was the most influencing interaction on the PNP removal efficiency. The mass transfer of PNP at the solution/adsorbent interface was described using pseudo-first-order and intraparticle diffusion. Langmuir isotherm well fitted the experimental equilibrium data with a satisfactory maximum adsorption capacity of 122.09 mg/g. The PNP adsorption process was thermodynamically spontaneous and endothermic. The regeneration study showed that the montmorillonite clay exhibited an excellent recycling capability.

Recycling of phosphate mine tailings for the production of geopolymers,"['Moukannaa, S', ' Loutou, M', ' Benzaazoua, M', ' Vitola, L', ' Alami, J', ' Hakkou, R']","Phosphate sludge is a fine by-product produced with large quantities during ore phosphate beneficiation (washing and flotation), and deposited in surface impoundment without treatment, which create environmental issues. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential reuse of phosphate sludge as a partial replacement of fly ash and metakaolin for the production of geopolymers. Geopolymers were prepared by mixing phosphate sludge with metakaolin or with fly ash in a proportion of 50 wt%. The effects of the main experimental factors (NaOH concentration, curing temperature and curing time) on the main physical characteristics (density, water absorption and compressive strength) were assessed using an experimental design of response surface methodology (DOE). The microstructure of geopolymer samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Analysis of variance confirmed that the adopted DOE model described well the experimentally observed properties. The results of the microstructural analysis showed that the development of a gel-like phase was favored by the increase of sodium hydroxide concentration (from 8 to 14M) for the two kinds, fly ash and metakaolin-based geopolymers. The physical properties of the geopolymers indicated that an increase of temperature and NaOH concentration led to strengthen and dense materials, while the addition of phosphate sludge resulted in a reduction on the mechanical properties. However, substitution of fly ash by phosphate sludge resulted in strong specimens (62 MPa), which indicated that the use of phosphate mine tailings in geopolymers can be a viable technological solution for the sustainable management of these by-products.

For that we studied the adsorption mechanism of methylene blue (MB) on chemically treated artichoke leaves (T-AL). To understand the adsorption process of the system Dye/T-AL various studies were performed. Parametric studies of MB adsorption with and without different salts were carried out using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The obtained results showed that the adsorption of MB alone (mono-system) is mainly related to pH and adsorbent dose. In the presence of salts, the adsorption efficiency of MB is principally linked to the pH of the solution and the initial concentration of salts. Even the nature of salts influences the capacity of MB adsorption. The kinetic data were analyzed using different models. It was observed that the pseudo-second-order model was the best model describing the adsorption behavior of MB onto (T-AL) in the mono-system (Dye/T-AL), bi-system, (Dye; Salt)/T-AL and mixed system with different salts (Dye; Sigma Mixed Salts)/T-AL. By analyzing the adsorption isotherm data, it was found that the MB adsorption in all studied systems is better suited to the Langmuir model. Furthermore, the values of thermodynamic parameters Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees, and Delta S degrees indicate that the interaction is thermodynamically favorable and that the adsorption mechanism is exothermic with physical nature.

To the Northwest of the basin, the phosphate layers crop out or are at a shallow depth and are exploited in open pit mines. By contrast, towards the central and southwestern parts of the basin, the phosphate layers lay below the Plio-Quaternary sediments of the Tadla Plain. This study aims to characterize the distribution and structure of the phosphatic series at depth under this cover, in particular to guide the future exploration and exploitation of the phosphate deposits. The work is based on gravimetric and seismic data acquired in a previous oil exploration study, calibrated by borehole data. The analysis of the gravity data controlled by boreholes first reveals the existence of large regional faults in the basin, forming pronounced gradients in the gravity data. The faults are also seen in the seismic profiles. In the Southeast of the basin, the phosphatic series exhibit a stairway structure controlled by some of these regional faults. The drilling data and the isochron maps established from the seismic profiles show that the base of the phosphatic series is more than 500 m deep in the southeastern area of the basin. As the phosphatic layers get buried deeper, they also become thicker. The phosphate reserves thus increase towards the southeast, and our analysis identifies the areas where this reserve is larger. Our results eventually suggest that the mining methods currently adopted in the Khouribga mining district will need to be modified and adapted to the more complex situation of the phosphatic series deeply buried in the basin.

This paper aims to characterize old, low-grade, silver tailings generated by the former Zgounder silver mine, located in Morocco. Understanding the mineralogical composition, particularly the silver deportment, was critical to allow the recovery of silver from these tailings. More than 88 samples of low grade tailings were sampled and characterized using chemical and mineralogical techniques. Froth flotation was used to recover silver bearing minerals using a combination of different collectors (dithiophosphate, dialkyl dithiophosphinates, Aero 7518, Aero 7640, alkyl dithiophosphates and potassium butyl-xanthate). The main goal was to optimize the flotation process at a laboratory scale through the testing of different parameters, such as collectors and frother types and dosage, activators and sulphidizing agents, and pH conditions. The characterization results showed that silver content varied between 30 and 440 ppm with an overall average content of 148 ppm. Silver occurs mainly in the form of native silver as well as in association with sulphides, such as acanthite and pyrite. Minor amounts of sphalerite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and hematite were identified. The flotation results showed the following optimum conditions: particle size of 63 mu m, conditioning pH of 8.5, a combination of butyl-xanthate and dithiophosphate as collectors at a dosage of 80 g/t each, a concentration of 200 g/t of the activating agent (CuSO4), 30 g/t of methyl isobutyl carbonyl (MIBC) frother and a duration time of 8 min with slow kinetics. With these optimal conditions, it was possible to achieve a maximum silver recovery yield of 84% with 1745 ppm Ag grade to be cyanided. Moreover, the environmental behavior of the final clean tailings was demonstrated to be inert using Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) leaching tests.","['Zgoundermine', ' silver', ' tailings', ' low-grade silver ores', ' flotation', ' mineralogical characterization', 'GOLD', ' MINERALIZATION', ' TEMPERATURE', ' PRICES']",2018.0,MINERALS-BASEL,"['Geochemistry & Geophysics', ' Mineralogy', ' Mining & Mineral Processing']",[''],False,1,False,38

Conversion of Brazilian savannah to agricultural land affects quantity and quality of labile soil organic matter,"['Santos, RS', ' Wiesmeier, M', ' Oliveira, DMS', ' Locatelli, JL', ' Barreto, MSC', ' Dematte, JAM', ' Cerri, CEP']","Most studies assessing land-use change (LUC) and management impacts on the soil organic carbon (SOC) budget mainly focused on total soil organic matter (SOM), neglecting its functional fractions such as water-extractable organic matter (WEOM). This may limit a better understanding of SOC dynamics along the soil profile as WEOM plays a key role in several soil and microbial processes. Here, we aimed to obtain a quantitative and qualitative assessment of WEOM dynamics to 1 m depth in areas after native vegetation conversion to long-term agriculture in Brazil. For this purpose, cropland areas under no-tillage (NT; similar to 23 years old) and native vegetation (NV; i.e., Cerrado vegetation) were evaluated across a transect of 1000 km within Brazil's new agricultural frontier - the so-called MATOPIBA region. We combined spectroscopic analyses (UV-Vis and DRIFT spectroscopies), C and nitrogen (N) determination in different SOM pools (i.e., bulk SOM, WEOM, and microbial biomass), and microbial measurements [e.g., microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), and p-glucosidase activity] to better understand changes in WEOM dynamics induced by LUC. We observed that although SOC decreased along the soil profile after NV (4.2-20.7 g kg(-1)) conversion to NT (3.8-14.2 g kg(-1)), water-extractable organic C levels (3.6-79.3 mg L-1) were similar between land uses. On the other hand, an increase in water-extractable total N was observed after NV (0.4-4.6 mg L-1) conversion to NT (0.5-19.3 mg L-1). Although MBC and MBN levels decreased for most study sites, beta-glucosidase activity increased after LUC indicating intensive microbial processing of SOM. As a result, WEOM had lower aromaticity and molecular weight (i.e., low values of SUVA254 and A2/A3) in NT than NV; and a relative decomposition of aliphatic and polysaccharides over aromatic and amine/amide was observed after LUC through DRIFT spectroscopy. Our study indicates that LUC had stronger impacts on WEOM quality than its quantity, with agricultural areas having more biochemical changes in WEOM than NV.","['Soil organic matter', ' WEOM', ' UV-Vis spectroscopy', ' DRIFT spectroscopy', ' No-tillage', ' Oxisol', 'EXTRACTION METHOD', ' MINERAL SURFACES', ' CARBON STOCKS', ' HUMIC ACIDS', ' MANAGEMENT', ' NITROGEN', ' DYNAMICS', ' LITTER', ' QUANTIFICATION', ' SPECTROSCOPY']",2022.0,GEODERMA,['Agriculture'],"['CAPES', 'FAPESP']",False,2,False,91

First, Zn-Al-CO3 and a series of Zn-Al/Ce-CO3 with different Ce content (5,10, 15, 20%) were synthesized through co-precipitation method at Zn/(Al thorn Ce) molar ratio (r) of 3, then subjected to calcination at 500 degrees C for 6 h. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis and pH point of zero charge. The experimental results of the photodegradation reveal that the photocatalyst developed from Zn-Al-Ce10%-CO3 LDH exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, with a degradation efficiency of 99.8% after 300 min of irradiation.

A Galerkin-Characteristic Finite Element Method for Three-Dimensional Convection-Dominated Problems,"['Khouya, B', ' El-Amrani, M', ' Seaid, M']","We present an efficient Galerkin-characteristic finite element method for the numerical solution of convection-diffusion problems in three space dimensions. The modified method of characteristics is used to discretize the convective term in a finite element framework. Different types of finite elements are implemented on three-dimensional unstructured meshes. To allocate the departure points we consider an efficient search-locate algorithm for three-dimensional domains. The crucial step of interpolation in the convection step is carried out using the basis functions of the tetrahedron element where the departure point is located. The resulting semi-discretized system is then solved using an implicit time-stepping scheme. The combined method is unconditionally stable such as no Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition is required for the selection of time steps in the simulations. The performance of the proposed Galerkin-characteristic finite element method is verified for the transport of a Gaussian sphere in a three-dimensional rotational flow. We also apply the method for simulation of a transport problem in a three-dimensional pipeline flow. In these test problems, the method demonstrates its ability to accurately capture the three-dimensional transport features.","['Three-dimensional convection-diffusion equations', ' Galerkin-characteristic method', ' finite elements', ' unstructured grids', ' convection-dominated problems', 'ADVECTION', ' CONVERGENCE', ' STABILITY', ' ALGORITHM', ' SCHEME']",2021.0,ADV APPL MATH MECH,"['Mathematics', ' Mechanics']",['CSIC'],False,1,False,25

In this study, we investigated some of the mechanisms involved in the resistance to Orobanche crenata and O. foetida for two Tunisian resistant varieties Najeh and Chourouk in comparison with the susceptible variety Badi. The results showed that, for Najeh and Chourouk, the Orobanche infestation did not significantly influence the plant growth as indicated by inconsiderable changes in the shoot and root dry weights, pod setting and chlorophyll and carotenoid contents. In comparison to Badi, both resistant varieties showed a reduced Orobanche attachments/tubercles number and dry weights, low H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation with increased levels of peroxidase activity in the roots. An Orobanche infestation was found to induce a significant decrease in the total lipid content and lipid unsaturation in the Badi leaves only. For resistant varieties, no significant changes were observed in these two parameters, which may indicate conservation and stability in the membrane fluidity. The resistance of Najeh and Chourouk was mainly associated with a relatively more efficient enzymatic antioxidative response and reduced lipid peroxidation that helped the plants to avoid the damaging effect of an Orobanche attack. Therefore, these two varieties could be used as a component of an integrated control strategy to improve the plant growth and productivity under an Orobanche infestation.","['antioxidant', ' fatty acids', ' broomrapes', ' genetic resistance', 'CICER-ARIETINUM L.', ' OXIDATIVE STRESS', ' SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE', ' LIPID-COMPOSITION', ' RAMOSA INFECTION', ' FOETIDA POIR.', ' CRENATA', ' PEROXIDASE', ' PLANT', ' GENOTYPES']",2020.0,PLANT PROTECT SCI,"['Agriculture', ' Plant Sciences']","['Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries and Hydraulic Resources', 'MHESR']",False,2,False,48
A partition of unity finite element method for three-dimensional transient diffusion problems with sharp gradients,"['Malek, M', ' Izem, N', ' Mohamed, MS', ' Seaid, M', ' Laghrouche, O']","An efficient partition of unity finite element method for three-dimensional transient diffusion problems is presented. A class of multiple exponential functions independent of time variable is proposed to enrich the finite element approximations. As a consequence of this procedure, the associated matrix for the linear system is evaluated once at the first time step and the solution is obtained at subsequent time step by only updating the right-hand side of the linear system. This results in an efficient numerical solver for transient diffusion equations in three space dimensions. Compared to the conventional finite element methods with h-refinement, the proposed approach is simple, more efficient and more accurate. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using several test examples for transient diffusion in three space dimensions. We present numerical results for a transient diffusion equation with known analytical solution to quantify errors for the new method. We also solve time-dependent diffusion problems in complex geometries.

Although the obtained results are interesting, the algorithm shows its limits since it is based on the local sensitivities of the outputs with respect to the unknown parameters of the model and may significantly affect the reliability of the model. In this work, the algorithm is improved by computing the sensitivities by means of the method of global sensitivity analysis. For demonstration purposes, different sets of experimental measurements of sulfuric acid solutions are carried out at different temperatures and acid concentrations. They mainly consist of pH, density, conductivity and molality measurements. The improved algorithm is then applied to each of the experimental sets. The most estimable parameters are determined and identified using a branch-and-reduce optimization method and their accuracy is assessed by means of confidence intervals.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of granulating biochar (BC) with triple superphosphate (TSP) in two forms (blend or coated) and three proportions (5, 15 and 25%, w/w) on the P release kinetics and plant growth. A successive plant trial using two soils of contrasting P buffering capacities and five P doses (0, 20, 40, 80 and 120 mg kg(-1)) was set to investigate the agronomic effectiveness of OMP that presented the slowest P release kinetic. The kinetic test showed that within the first 1.5 h, TSP, OMP blend and OMP coated fertilizers released 92, 82 and 36% of total P, respectively. Thereby, BC addition to TSP reduced the P release rate, mainly due to coating. The fertilizers coated with 15% and 25% BC (C15 and C25, respectively) presented the slowest P release rate. For the plant trial, C15 was chosen because it requires less BC when compared with C25 fertilizer. In the first crop, C15 provided more P to plants, especially in the soil with high P buffering capacity, which increased by 10% and 20% the P uptake and the P recovered by the plant when compared with TSP, respectively. In the sandy soil, fertilizers C15 and TSP showed the same performances regarding yield, P uptake and P recovery rate. At consecutive cultivation, regardless of the soil type, P sources (C15 and TSP) did not differ in yield, P uptake and P recovery. Therefore, biochar-based organomineral phosphate fertilizer can enhance P use efficiency in high P-fixing tropical soils, increasing P recovery and uptake when compared with TSP.

Although surface analysis of cycled electrodes reveals no apparent difference in solid electrolyte interphase layer formed on the nano- and micro-Sn electrodes, we found that in the case of nano-Sn electrodes the moderately porous composite layers and thin binder coating on Sn particles are responsible for a favorable cycle performance. On the other hand, the dense and less-porous micro-Sn electrode having a relatively thicker coating of binder on micro-Sn particles deteriorates the reversibility of sodium alloying reaction. Therefore, we optimize the electrode preparation process to introduce the suitable porosity and properly thin binder coating in the micro-Sn composite electrodes.

When A is symmetric and W = V, we describe how error bounds or estimates of bounds for the trace can be computed by pairs of Gauss and Gauss-Radau quadrature rules, or by pairs of Gauss and anti-Gauss quadrature rules. These Gauss-type quadrature rules are defined by recursion coefficients for the shifted extended global Lanczos processes. Gauss and anti-Gauss quadrature rules also can be applied to give estimates of error bounds for the trace when A is nonsymmetric and W not equal V.

SeSaMe provides not only a means for estimating taxonomic diversity and abundance but also the gene reservoir of the reference taxonomic groups associated with AMF.

Analysis and trends of rainfall amounts and extreme events in the Western Mediterranean region,"['Benabdelouahab, T', ' Gadouali, F', ' Boudhar, A', ' Lebrini, Y', ' Hadria, R', ' Salhi, A']","Since the dawn of civilization, the Western Mediterranean region has been a unique path for encounters and exchanges. The stability of the general conditions prevailing in its surrounding was crucial to ensure this vital link between north and south and east and west. However, any imbalance would be the precursor of a harmful domino effect to these environments, where the natural vulnerabilities are combined to a worsening socioeconomic congestion. In both banks, efforts are made not to give way to the fragile balance of water availability and risks. Here, we show that the amount and recurrence of extreme rainfall events contradict with current management scenarios. Our pixel-based assessment of the rain components extracted from the African Rainfall Climatology product reveals an annual increase in the total amount of rainfall and extreme rainfall events. A spatial and a trend analysis of the studied rainfall components were carried out to determine their spatial patterns and magnitude. The cumulative annual rainfall alone will not mean if a year is dry or wet. A wet year can experience great periods of drought, which will have serious repercussions on the socioeconomic and ecological levels. In addition, the increased occurrence of extreme rains can produce floods, intensifying land degradation processes, loss of biodiversity, water availability and economic growth. Decision-makers should be aware that current models of territorial management will not be able to cope with this change and that interdisciplinary cohesion and cross-border actions are the most appropriate solution.

Late-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws on the sphere,"['Beljadid, A', ' Lefloch, PG', ' Mohammadian, A']","We consider nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws posed on a curved geometry, referred to as geometric Burgers equations after Ben-Artzi and LeFloch (2007), when the underlying geometry is the sphere and the flux vector field is determined from a potential function. Despite its apparent simplicity, this model exhibits complex wave phenomena which are not observed in absence of geometrical effects. To study the late-time asymptotic behavior of the solutions of this model, we consider a finite volume method based on a generalized Riemann solver. We provide a numerical validation of the accuracy and efficiency of the method in presence of nonlinear waves and a curved geometry and, especially, demonstrate the contraction, time-variation monotonicity, and entropy monotonicity properties. The late-time asymptotic behavior of the solutions is studied and discussed in terms of the properties of the flux. A new classification of the flux vector field is introduced where we distinguish between foliated flux and generic flux, and the character of linearity of the flux which are expected to be sufficient to predict the late-time asymptotic behavior of the solutions. When the flux is foliated and linear, the solutions are transported in time within the level sets of the potential. If the flux is foliated and is genuinely nonlinear, the solutions converge to their (constant) average within each level set. For generic flux, the solutions evolve with large variations which depend on the geometry and converge to constant values within certain independent domains on the sphere. The number of constant values depends on curves that split the sphere into independent domains. For fluxes which are linear, foliated or generic only on parts of the sphere, combinations of the late-time asymptotic behavior of the solutions can be obtained which depends also on the interaction between the fluxes at boundaries of these parts of the sphere.

Waste rocks were collected from a gold mining site (Quebec, Canada) and prepared using crushing and sieving methods. Acid generation potential, chemical analysis, mineralogy and pollution potential of waste rocks were assessed. Concrete mixtures were then prepared using crushed waste rocks and their mechanical performances and environmental properties were evaluated. The results showed that waste rocks sample contains 46% of coarse material similar to the normalized concrete aggregates.

The experimental setup mainly consists of an insulated rectangular basin, filled with 19 kg of saline water, painted black and installed south-facing onto the flat roof of a building located in the Meknes city (Latitude: 33 degrees 53'36 '' North; Longitude: 5 degrees 32'50 '' West). The device was equipped with K-type thermocouples which were connected to a data logger and laptop computer in order to measure and record different temperatures. Emphasis focused on the influence of winter (2020) ambient conditions and storage materials (air, sand and paraffin wax) on the thermal efficiency and pure water productivity of the desalination system. Weather conditions of winter days (sunny, cloudy, rainy, windy, warm, cold) significantly impact the yield of solar still. Heat is stored (or retrieved) as sensible heat for sand unlike paraffin wax (Phase Change Material: PCM) which stores/retrieves heat in both modes: sensible and latent. Temperature melting of the PCM was not reached for unfavorable weather conditions (rainy, cloudy and windy days). The sensible heat storage/retrieval mode is predominant while the latent mode appears for a short period (about 25 min). Latent heat storage mode allows storing a huge amount of heat (> 1 MJ), hence the using of heat storage system (sand and paraffin wax) enhances the overall thermal efficiency by 152.8 and 223.09%, respectively, compared to conventional solar still. In conclusion, a solar distiller coupled with a heat storage system is a promising technology for desalination in arid and semi-arid regions which are confronting to a severe scarcity of fresh water as the same time they have abundant amounts of brackish water.","['Solar distiller', ' Distillate output', ' Heat storage material', ' Sand', ' Paraffin wax', ' Weather conditions', 'PHASE-CHANGE MATERIAL', ' DESALINATION', ' SYSTEM', ' WATER', ' DISTILLATION', ' EXERGY']",2021.0,J ENERGY STORAGE,['Energy & Fuels'],[''],False,1,False,44

Such changes are having a strong impact on the agro-physiological functioning of plants that scale up to influence interactions between plants and microorganisms and hence ecosystems. In (semi)-arid ecosystems, the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) -an irreplaceable tree- plays important socio-economic roles. In the current study, we implemeted an adapted management program to improve date palm development and its tolerance to water deficit by using single or multiple combinations of exotic and native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF1 and AMF2 respectively), and/or selected consortia of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR: B1 and B2), and/or composts from grasses and green waste (C1 and C2, respectively). We analyzed the potential for physiological functioning (photosynthesis, water status, osmolytes, mineral nutrition) to evolve in response to drought since this will be a key indicator of plant resilience in future environments. As result, under water deficit, the selected biofertilizers enhanced plant growth, leaf water potential, and electrical conductivity parameters. Further, the dual-inoculation of AMF/PGPR amended with composts alone or in combination boosted the biomass under water deficit conditions to a greater extent than in non-inoculated and/or non-amended plants. Both single and dual biofertilizers improved physiological parameters by elevating stomatal conductance, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids content), and photosynthetic efficiency. The dual inoculation and compost significantly enhanced, especially under drought stress, the concentrations of sugar and protein content, and antioxidant enzymes (polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase) activities as a defense strategy as compared with controls. Under water stress, we demonstrated that phosphorus was improved in the inoculated and amended plants alone or in combination in leaves (AMF2: 807%, AMF1+B2: 657%, AMF2+C1+B2: 500%, AMF2+C2: 478%, AMF1: 423%) and soil (AMF2: 397%, AMF1+B2: 322%, AMF2+C1+B2: 303%, AMF1: 190%, C1: 188%) in comparison with controls under severe water stress conditions.

Therefore, in silico tools could be utilized for building the bridge between the legacy of the past and the current medical approaches allowing access to new therapeutic discoveries. In this work, a Chinese traditional medicine database was screened using structure-based virtual screening to identify molecules that could inhibit p38 alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Out of the identified compounds, four selected compounds: chrysophanol, physcion, curcumin and hesperidin were isolated from their respective sources and their structures were confirmed by spectroscopic methods.

The molecular docking study revealed the specificity of these compounds towards p38 MAPK rather than other MAPKs.

LES of Reacting Flow in a Hydrogen Jet into Supersonic Crossflow Combustor Using a New Turbulent Combustion Model,"['Boukharfane, R', ' Techer, A', ' Er-raiy, A']","Modelling the complete flow physics and chemical kinetics of supersonic combustion is a particularly complex and daunting task that requires significant computational resources. To foster performance evaluation tools for future hypersonic vehicles, developing accurate yet computationally efficient solution methods is of great importance. In this work, a new subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations is derived and used in a three-dimensional in-house flow solver to provide simulations of experimental scramjet ground tests. In particular, this paper introduces a hybrid model closure with the reaction-rate approach to close the filtered chemical source terms in the governing equations for species mass fractions and total energy. The model developed here makes use of a linear bridging function, depending on the segregation rate of the mixture fraction, between a resolved contribution issued from a perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) estimation, and a subgrid-scale (SGS) contribution where a closure that approximates the Lagrangian trajectory in the composition space is retained. The new model considers the effect of fluctuations of compositions and can be extended to take into account, for example, the fluctuations of temperature. The new approach is tested using a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor from circular injector into a Mach 2 vitiated airflow for total pressure and temperature of 0.40 MPa and 1695 K, respectively. The selected operating conditions are representative of the LAPCAT-II dual-mode ramjet/scramjet combustion. Chemistry is described using a four-step reduced mechanism. The results obtained with the present modelling proposal are compared to those issued from numerical simulations performed with the quasi-laminar chemistry or PSR approach. These results do show that, even for a highly resolved computational mesh, the effects of composition fluctuations remain significant, especially in the vicinity of the injection where the SGS fluctuations of the scalar field are non-negligible.","['Turbulent combustion', ' Large-eddy simulation', ' Compressible Navier-Stokes equations', ' Reacting jet in crossflow', 'LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION', ' CHEMISTRY']",,INT J AERONAUT SPACE,['Engineering'],[''],False,1,False,38

The material characterisation was performed using environmental scanning electron microscopy.

Plasmonic mode coupling and thin film sensing in metal-insulator-metal structures,"['Andam, N', ' Refki, S', ' Hayashi, S', ' Sekkat, Z']","Optical sensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in the attenuated total reflection (ATR) configuration in layered media have attracted considerable attention over the past decades owing to their ability of label free sensing in biomolecular interaction analysis, and highly sensitive detection of changes in refractive index and thickness, i.e. the optical thickness, of thin film adsorbates (thin film sensing). Furthermore, SPR is highly sensitive to the refractive index of the medium adjacent to the bare metal, and it allows for bulk sensing as well. When deposited at the metal/air interface, an adsorbed layer disturbs the highly localized, i.e. bound, wave at this interface and changes the plasmon resonance to allow for sensing in angular or wavelength interrogation and intensity measurement modes. A high degree of sensitivity is required for precise and efficient sensing, especially for biomolecular interaction analysis for early stage diagnostics; and besides conventional SPR (CSPR), several other configurations have been developed in recent years targeting sensitivity, including long-range SPR (LRSPR) and waveguide-coupled SPR (WGSPR) observed in MIM structures, referred here to by MIM modes, resulting from the coupling of SPRs at I/M interfaces, and Fano-type resonances occurring from broad and sharp modes coupling in layered structures. In our previous research, we demonstrated that MIM is better than CSPR for bulk sensing, and in this paper, we show that CSPR is better than MIM for thin film sensing for thicknesses of the sensing layer (SL) larger than 10 nm. We discuss and compare the sensitivity of CSPR and MIM for thin film sensing by using both experiments and theoretical calculations based on rigorous electromagnetic (EM) theory. We discuss in detail MIM modes coupling and anti-crossing, and we show that when a thin film adsorbate, i.e. a SL), is deposited on top of the outermost-layer of an optimized MIM structure, it modifies the characteristics of the coupled modes of the structure, and it reduces the electric field, both inside the SL and at the SL/air interface, and as a result, it decreases the sensitivity of the MIM versus the CSPR sensor. Our work is of critical importance to plasmonic mode coupling using MIM configurations, as well as to optical bio- and chemical-sensing.","['AZO-DYE', ' GOLD NANOPARTICLES', ' RESONANCE', ' LIGHT', ' PHOTOISOMERIZATION', ' ORIENTATION', ' BIOSENSORS', ' SENSORS', ' SINGLE']",2021.0,SCI REP-UK,['Science & Technology - Other Topics'],['MEFCRS'],False,1,False,55

The aim of this work is to determine the inhibition efficiency based on the concentration of studied inhibitors and the temperature effect of medium. The maximum inhibition efficiency (approximate to 88%) was obtained in the presence of the optimum inhibitor concentration of 1.0 x 10(-2) M for C3 at 291 K. The experimental data showed that the inhibition efficiency of these inhibitors increases with the increase of their concentrations. The temperature effect on the corrosion inhibition of (SS) in 0.5 M HCl with and without inhibitors at different concentrations was investigated from 291 K to 318 K temperature range. It should be noted that each test has been carried out at least three times. Besides, the result was calculated by averaging the obtained values of each test. The activation energy and thermodynamic parameters evaluated from the weight loss measurements, suggested that the adsorption is spontaneous, exothermic, and obeyed the Villamil adsorption isotherm. SEM analyses confirmed that C3 is a good inhibitor compared with C1 and C2. Molecular dynamics simulations diagnosis for molecule/metal interaction showed that the studied organic compounds have strong interactions with Fe (110) and therefore good inhibition power for AISI 316 austenitic stainless steel (SS) against corrosion.

Flotation tests were conducted to reprocess the tailings for Au, Ag, and Cu recovery, and at the same time to prevent acid mine drainage (AMD) generation through the oxidation of sulfide minerals, including pyrite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, galena. The flotation results confirmed that environmental desulfurization is effective at reducing the overall sulfide content in the tailings. The recovery of sulfides was between 69% and 75%, while Au recovery weight-yield was between 2.8% and 4.7%.

Such disruption, affecting multiple systems interfaces in smallholder agriculture, is unprecedented and needs to be understood from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The multiple loops of causality in the pathways of impact renders the system outcomes unpredictable. Understanding the nature of such unpredictable pathways is critical to identify present and future systems intervention strategies. Our study aims to explore the multiple pathways of present and future impact created by the pandemic and ?Amphan? cyclonic storm on smallholder agricultural systems. Also, we anticipate the behaviour of the systems elements under different realistic scenarios of intervention. We explored the severity and multi-faceted impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable smallholder agricultural production systems through in-depth interactions with key players at the micro-level. It provided contextual information, and revealed critical insights to understand the cascading effect of the pandemic and the cyclone on farm households. We employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders in Sundarbans areas in eastern India, to identify the present and future systems outcomes caused by the pandemic, and later compounded by ?Amphan?. The immediate adaptation strategies of the farmers were engaging family labors, exchanging labors with neighbouring farmers, borrowing money from relatives, accessing free food rations, replacing dead livestock, early harvesting, and reclamation of waterbodies. The thematic analysis identified several systems elements, such as harvesting, marketing, labor accessibility, among others, through which the impacts of the pandemic were expressed. Drawing on these outputs, we employed Mental Modeler, a Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping tool, to develop multi-stakeholder mental models for the smallholder agricultural systems of the region. Analysis of the mental models indicated the centrality of ?Kharif?

Current household expenditure, livestock, and soil fertility were other central elements in the shared mental model. Scenario analysis with multiple stakeholders suggested enhanced market access and current household income, sustained investment in farming, rapid improvement in affected soil, irrigation water and livestock as the most effective strategies to enhance the resilience of farm families during and after the pandemic. This study may help in formulating short and long-term intervention strategies in the post-pandemic communities, and the methodological approach can be used elsewhere to understand perturbed socioecological systems to formulate anticipatory intervention strategies based on collective wisdom of stakeholders.","['System perturbation', ' Lockdown', ' Amphan cyclone', ' Coping strategies', ' Qualitative analysis', ' Indian Sundarbans']",2021.0,AGR SYST,['Agriculture'],[''],False,1,False,74

Electrochemical Performance and Mechanisms of NaSn2(PO4)(3)/C Composites as Anode Materials for Li-Ion Batteries,"['Difi, S', ' Nassiri, A', ' Saadoune, I', ' Sougrati, MT', ' Lippens, PE']","NaSn2(PO4)(3)/C composites obtained by solid-state and pyrolysis reactions present high capacity retention and high-rate capability as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. The structure of NaSn2(PO4)(3) was analyzed by combining X-ray diffraction and density functional theory to confirm the R (3) over bar space group. The composite is formed by submicrometer particles with a cube-like shape coated by pyrolytic carbon that improves the electronic percolation. The Sn-119 Mossbauer spectroscopy shows the existence of Sn4+ with a more ionic character than SnO2, which can be related to the inductive effect of the phosphate groups. This technique was used in the operando mode to follow the reaction with lithium during the first discharge that is a crucial step for improving the performance. A two-step mechanism has been identified that consists of the irreversible transformation of the pristine material into Sn-0 species for the first half of the discharge followed by reversible Li-Sn-0 alloying reactions. The Mossbauer spectra of the Sn-0 species differ from the spectrum of beta Sn because of their nanosize and the existence of chemical bonds with the sodium phosphate matrix formed during the conversion reaction. The first part of the discharge should be considered as a restructuration of the pristine material leading to the dispersion of Sn-0 small particles in strong interaction with the phosphate matrix and providing good cyclability.

Seasonality in Intermittent Streamflow Losses Beneath a Semiarid Mediterranean Wadi,"['Fakir, Y', ' Bouimouass, H', ' Constantz, J']","Streamflow losses beneath ephemeral and intermittent streams are potentially major contributors to groundwater recharge. Compared to ephemeral streams, intermittent streams often have more than one season of streamflow and often experience shorter zero-flow periods during the dry seasons and typically longer wet season of steady streamflow. Intermittent streams losses are lacking significant investigation on their variability over wet and dry season, and on the influence on potential groundwater recharge of flooding streamflow compared with more gradual wet seasonal baseflow. To address these issues, both streambed-sediment water content and temperature were continuously logged over a year for an intermittent stream (wadi) under semi-arid conditions in Central Morocco. Water content measurements uniquely distinguished between downward percolation and upward advance of the wetting front due to the rise of the water table, whereas temperature modeling was used to estimate vertical fluxes of percolated water. For the year of data, more than 90% of the estimated potential recharge occurred during winter and spring, when the alluvium typically has a higher water moisture, with most recharge generated during flooding conditions. Winter and spring baseflow generally generated low infiltration, though importantly contributes to wetting the sediment for rapid, deep percolation during flooding. Alternatively, summer flashfloods over dry sediment resulted in shallower infiltration despite higher peak streamflows. Thus, clear seasonality (seasonal variation) in relations between amounts of streamflow, streamflow loss, and depth of wetting into the streambed were distinguished over the study year. Finally, lateral recharge was detected, leading to additional seasonal water-table fluctuation beneath the wadi.","['Temperature', ' water content', ' streamflow', ' infiltration', ' groundwater recharge', 'HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY', ' GROUNDWATER RECHARGE', ' TEMPERATURE PROFILES', ' RIVER-BASIN', ' INFILTRATION', ' DYNAMICS', ' FLOW', ' SIMULATION', ' TRANSPORT', ' DESERT']",2021.0,WATER RESOUR RES,"['Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Marine & Freshwater Biology', ' Water Resources']","['Fulbright program', 'MACECE', 'ERANETMED', 'PRIMA', 'SAGESSE']",False,5,False,56

Pea (Pisum sativum) peel extract attenuates DOX-induced oxidative myocardial injury,"['Abdelghffar, EA', ' Obaid, WA', ' Elgamal, AM', ' Daoud, R', ' Sobeh, M', ' El Raey, MA']","The goal of this work aimed to evaluate the protective effects of pea (Pisum sativum) peels extract versus doxorubicin-induced oxidative myocardial injury in male mice. The mice were divided into seven groups (n = 7): (I) control group; (II) P. sativum 250 group; (III) P. sativum 500 group; (IV) DOX (3 times alternately of 2.5 mg/ kg/week, i.p. for a continuous two-week period) group; (V) Vit.

Twenty polyphenolic compounds, mainly flavonoid glycosides such as quercetin, kaempferol apigenin, and phenolics compounds were characterized by LC-MS/MS analysis in the examined extract. DOX administration elevated the activities of serum biomarkers of myocardial dysfunction (ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, troponin, CPK, and CK-MB), lipid profile, and proinflammatory cytokines. Also, it decreased cardiac antioxidants (GSH, SOD, GPX, CAT) and increased myocardial markers of oxidative stress (NO and MDA) and inflammatory marker (MPO). As well as it downregulated and upregulated the Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic gene) and the Bax (pro-apoptotic gene) expressions, respectively. Pre-treatment of DOX-exposed mice with P. sativum or vitamin E (as a reference protective antioxidant) alleviated the changes dose-dependently via DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. These data show that P. sativum has a cardio-protective impact against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte damage in mice via boosting endogenous antioxidants, decreasing inflammation, and regulating BcL-2 and Bax apoptosis pathway, which might be related to the presence of flavonoid glycosides.

Hydrogels based on cellulose derivatives can absorb and retain a huge amount of water in the interstitial sites of their structures, stimulating their uses in various useful industrial purposes. In this work, cross-linked superabsorbent composite hydrogel films (CHF) were designed, manufactured and characterized, by taking advantage of the combination of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and newly developed regenerated cellulose (RC) spheres. RC with sphere-like shape was successfully prepared using a green method based on cold phosphoric acid-mediated dissolution of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) followed by regeneration process using water as anti-solvent. Prior to be used, the morphological and structural properties of RC spheres, with an average diameter of 477 270 nm, were examined by SEM, AFM, XRD, FTIR and TGA techniques. CHF crosslinked with citric acid were, in fact, prepared by solvent casting method with different RC weight fractions (i.e. 0, 2.5, 5,10 and 15 wt%), then the crosslinking reaction was triggered by thermal treatment at 80 degrees C during 8 h.

Inhibiting effect of textile wastewater on the activity of sludge from the biological treatment process of the activated sludge plant,"['Gebrati, L', ' El Achaby, M', ' Chatoui, H', ' Laqbaqbi, M', ' El Kharraz, J', ' Aziz, F']","Textile industry represents an important source of toxic substances rejected in environment. Indeed, effluent of these industries contains dyes and chemicals. They are rejected in environment without any treatment. The aim of this work is to evaluate ecotoxicological effect of industrial textile effluents on the sludge harvested from activated sludge treatment plant of Marrakech city (Morocco). For this, we are interested in determining the inhibition condition that corresponds to 50% decrease of bacterial activity in sludge. Obtained results showed that inhibition percentage of bacterial activity depends narrowly on contact time and on added effluent volume, until a limit concentration where there is no degradation of substratum. In fact, substratum degradation speed shows about 65 times decrease when 80% (v/v) of textile wastewater is added, in comparison with the controlled one. Consequently the inhibition constant (Ki) that corresponds to 50% of bacterial inhibition activity is estimated to 0.65 mg l(-1) of dye. These studies confirm a real ecotoxicological risk of these effluents. Therefore, a treatment is mandatory before their rejection in environment.

Groundwater recharge sources in semiarid irrigated mountain fronts,"['Bouimouass, H', ' Fakir, Y', ' Tweed, S', ' Leblanc, M']","High-elevation mountains often constitute for basins important groundwater recharge sources through mountain-front recharge processes. These processes include streamflow losses and subsurface inflow from the mountain block. However, another key recharge process is from irrigation practices, where mountain streamflow is distributed across the irrigated piedmont. In this study, coupled groundwater fluctuation measurements and environmental tracers (O-18, H-2, and major ions) were used to identify and compare the natural mountain-front recharge to the anthropogenically induced irrigation recharge. Within the High Atlas mountain front of the Ourika Basin, Central Morocco, the groundwater fluctuation mapping from the dry to wet season showed that recharge beneath the irrigated area was higher than the recharge along the streambed. Irrigation practices in the region divert more than 65% of the stream water, thereby reducing the potential for in-stream groundwater recharge. In addition, the irrigation areas close to the mountain front had greater water table increases (up to 3.5 m) compared with the downstream irrigation areas (<1 m increase). Upstream crops have priority to irrigation with stream water over downstream areas. The latter are only irrigated via stream water during large flood events and are otherwise supplemented by groundwater resources. These changes in water resources used for irrigation practices between upstream and downstream areas are reflected in the spatiotemporal evolution of the stable isotopes of groundwater. In the upstream irrigation area, the groundwater stable isotope values (delta O-18: -8.4 parts per thousand to -7.4 parts per thousand) reflect recharge by the diverted stream water. In the downstream irrigation area, the groundwater isotope values are lower (delta O-18: -8.1 parts per thousand to -8.4 parts per thousand) due to recharge via the flood water. In the nonirrigation area, the groundwater has the highest stable isotope values (delta O-18: -6.8 parts per thousand to -4.8 parts per thousand). This might be due to recharge via subsurface inflow from the mountain block to the mountain front and/or recharge via local low altitude rainfall. These findings highlight that irrigation practices can result in the dominant mountain-front recharge process for groundwater.","['alluvial aquifer', ' hydrochemistry', ' Morocco', ' piezometry', ' stables isotopes', ' streamflow', ' traditional irrigation', 'STABLE-ISOTOPES', ' SURFACE-WATER', ' AQUIFER RECHARGE', ' BLOCK RECHARGE', ' VADOSE ZONE', ' HIGH ATLAS', ' BASIN', ' RIVER', ' INFILTRATION', ' CLIMATE']",2020.0,HYDROL PROCESS,['Water Resources'],[''],False,1,False,69

Reverse Blending: An economically efficient approach to the challenge of fertilizer mass customization,"['Benhamou, L', ' Giard, V', ' Khouloud, M', ' Fenies, P', ' Fontane, F']","Reasoned fertilization, which is a major concern for sustainable and efficient agriculture, consists of applying customized fertilizers which requires a very large increase in the number of fertilizer formulae, involving increasing costs due to the multiplication of production batch, of storage areas and of transportation constraints. An alternative solution is given by adopting a Reverse Blending approach, which is a new Blending Problem where inputs are non-pre-existing composite materials that need to be defined in both number and composition, simultaneously with the quantities to be used in the blending process, such as to meet the specifications of a wide variety of outputs, while keeping their number as small as possible. This would replace the production of a large variety of small batches of fertilizers by few large batches of new composite materials whose blending may be performed close to end-users (delayed differentiation), delivering substantial production and logistics cost savings, well in excess of remote blending costs. Reverse Blending presents some analogies with the Pooling Problem which is a two-stage Blending Problem where primary inputs are existing raw materials. An adapted version of this problem may be used to facilitate the design of new composite materials used by Reverse Blending. This paper presents the Reverse Blending approach, whose modelling is based on a quadratic programming formulation, and a large case study to demonstrate its feasibility. Reverse Blending, therefore, may be a disruptive approach to successfully reengineer not only the fertilizer supply chain but any other industry operating in blending contexts to meet a great diversity.","['Mass customization', ' Continuous production', ' Blending', ' Composite material design', ' Fertilizer', ' Pooling problem', 'GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION', ' POOLING PROBLEMS', ' SUPPLY CHAIN', ' FORMULATIONS', ' POSTPONEMENT', ' DESIGN', ' MODEL', ' RELAXATIONS', ' NUTRITION', ' PRODUCTS']",2020.0,INT J PROD ECON,"['Engineering', ' Operations Research & Management Science']",[''],False,1,False,61

"Coupling landscape-scale diagnostics surveys, on-farm experiments, and simulation to identify entry points for sustainably closing rice yield gaps in Nepal","['Devkota, KP', ' Devkota, M', ' Paudel, GP', ' McDonald, AJ']","CONTEXT: Rice is the primary staple food crop in Nepal, contributing 20% of the agricultural gross domestic product and more than 50% of the total calories in the national diet. Nevertheless, the productivity of rice (3.36 t ha(-1)) is the lowest in South Asia region. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to employ a mixed-methods approach to characterize and decompose yield gaps (YGs) in the context of identifying sustainable intensification pathways for rice production in Nepal. METHODS: Methodologies include: a) landscape-scale crop diagnostic survey on crop management, field attributes, and productivity outcomes combined with gridded soil and daily weather data to decompose rice yield gaps into constituent factors with machine learning diagnostics; b) with survey data, computation of key performance indicators to identify factors associated with productivity, profitability, and resource use efficiencies; c) complementary multi-location on-farm experiments (2011-2017) evaluating new agronomic management practices; and d) dynamic simulation (ORYZA3) to derive estimates of rice yield potential. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of survey data suggests an exploitable YG of 2.57 t ha(-1) (40%) and the total YG of 4.85 t ha(-1) (55%) indicating substantial scope for increasing rice yields in Nepal. Frequency of irrigation, amount of late-season rainfall, soil type, amount of early-season rainfall, presence of water stress, soil pH, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer rates are the principal determinants of productivity outcomes in descending ranked order. Efficiency metrics suggest rice farmers in the study region make good use of fertilizer inputs, but since application rates are very low (e.g. most farmers apply <20 kg P ha(-1)) unsustainable mining of soil nutrients is likely common. Farmers in the top 10% of the yield distribution had lower greenhouse gas emission intensities (-43%), increased water productivity (+66%), and higher use efficiencies of N and P fertilizers (+28% and + 20%, respectively), suggesting that yield intensification can be achieved without tradeoffs with key environmental performance indicators. On-farm experiments conducted over several seasons support insights from surveys by demonstrating that major gains in rice yield (1.86 t ha(-1)) and profitability (US$ 243 ha(-1)) are achievable through the adoption of good agronomic practices. SIGNIFICANCE: Through a mixed methods approach, our results suggest that adoption of integrated 'good agronomic practices' can close YGs and improve food security outcomes associated with the rice-based agricultural systems of Nepal while simultaneously preserving or enhancing key sustainability and livelihood objectives.","['Yield gap', ' Sustainable intensification', ' Machine learning', ' Sustainability indicators', ' Good agronomic practices', 'GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS', ' RAIN-FED MIDHILLS', ' PRODUCTION SYSTEMS', ' CROP PRODUCTION', ' PRODUCTIVITY', ' MANAGEMENT', ' INTENSIFICATION', ' PROFITABILITY', ' CULTIVATION']",2021.0,AGR SYST,['Agriculture'],"['CSISA', 'USAID']",False,2,False,51

Two of the algorithms are block generalizations of the standard Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization method with the block size equal to the number of channels. One algorithm uses standard Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization without restarts for all right-hand sides. These schemes are compared to standard Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization applied to each right-hand side independently. Tikhonov regularization is used to avoid severe error propagation.

Plant secondary metabolites, among them polyphenols, represent an effective and much safer alternative approach to the currently available medications. In this work, utilizing LC-MS/MS, we characterized the constituents of S. yapa leaves extract and evaluated its antioxidant and anticancer properties. In total, 34 secondary metabolites, mainly flavonoids (Tricin, luteolin, and apigenin and their glucosides as well as sulfated derivatives) were identified. The extract manifested substantial antioxidant activity in DPPH assay, and high total phenolic content determined by Folin Ciocalteu method. The extract was safe up to 4800 mg/kg b.wt. when administered orally in mice and neither affected the hematological parameters nor the liver enzyme levels at the studied dose (LD50, 480 mg, kg b.wt.). In the treated animals, the extract surpassed the reference drug (5-flouro uracil) and significantly reduced the tumor volume and weight by 71.50 and 85.46%, respectively, increased the median survival time to 53.2 days and the lifespan by 116%. The extract improved all the hematological parameters, where it increased the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, red blood cell (RBC) count, packed cell volume (PVC) and platelets by 58.21, 8.98, 9.89 and 120%, respectively, compared to the untreated EAC bearing animals. Additionally, the extract significantly declined the elevated levels of ALT and AST enzymes by 29.18% and 59.88%, respectively. In molecular docking, the annotated flavonoids displayed appreciable binding affinities to the active sites of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.

Irrigation Amounts and Timing Retrieval through Data Assimilation of Surface Soil Moisture into the FAO-56 Approach in the South Mediterranean Region,"['Ouaadi, N', ' Jarlan, L', ' Khabba, S', ' Ezzahar, J', ' Le Page, M', ' Merlin, O']","Agricultural water use represents more than 70% of the world's freshwater through irrigation water inputs that are poorly known at the field scale. Irrigation monitoring is thus an important issue for optimizing water use in particular with regards to the water scarcity that the semi-arid regions are already facing. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a new approach to predict seasonal to daily irrigation timing and amounts at the field scale. The method is based on surface soil moisture (SSM) data assimilated into a simple land surface (FAO-56) model through a particle filter technique based on an ensemble of irrigation scenarios. The approach is implemented in three steps. First, synthetic experiments are designed to assess the impact of the frequency of observation, the errors on SSM and the a priori constraints on the irrigation scenarios for different irrigation techniques (flooding and drip). In a second step, the method is evaluated using in situ SSM measurements with different revisit times (3, 6 and 12 days) to mimic the available SSM product derived from remote sensing observation. Finally, SSM estimates from Sentinel-1 are used. Data are collected on different wheat fields grown in Morocco, for both flood and drip irrigation techniques in addition to rainfed fields used for an indirect evaluation of the method performance. Using in situ data, accurate results are obtained. With an observation every 6 days to mimic the Sentinel-1 revisit time, the seasonal amounts are retrieved with R > 0.98, RMSE < 32 mm and bias < 2.5 mm. Likewise, a good agreement is observed at the daily scale for flood irrigation as more than 70% of the detected irrigation events have a time difference from actual irrigation events shorter than 4 days. Over the drip irrigated fields, the statistical metrics are R = 0.74, RMSE = 24.8 mm and bias = 2.3 mm for irrigation amounts cumulated over 15 days. When using SSM products derived from Sentinel-1 data, the statistical metrics on 15-day cumulated amounts slightly dropped to R = 0.64, RMSE = 28.7 mm and bias = 1.9 mm. The metrics on the seasonal amount retrievals are close to assimilating in situ observations with R = 0.99, RMSE = 33.5 mm and bias = -18.8 mm. Finally, among four rainfed seasons, only one false event was detected.

However, the development of a high-performing anode material for these ion batteries is still to be explored. In this work, we conduct a first-principles study on the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of Potassium (K) and Sodium (Na) in a Graphene/Phosphorene (G/P) van der Waals nanoheterostructure, in order to assess its suitability as an anode for both K-ion and Na-ion batteries. We investigate the electrochemical properties of the system, including binding energies, band structure, ion diffusivity outside and in-side the G/P system, as well as the heterostructure's stability at a high metallic coverage. The calculated binding energies for K and Na are -2.69 eV and -2.42 eV, respectively, which are strong enough to prevent metallic clustering during the cycling. The diffusion of K/Na within G/P's regions shows strong directional anisotropy with a low diffusion barrier of 0.04 eV for K and 0.05 eV for Na along the zigzag direction. We also observe that the addition of K/Na atoms into the G/P system turns its semi-metallic nature into a metallic one. Moreover, we demonstrate that the intercalation of K/Na atoms within the G/P structure give low operating potentials of approximately 0.29 V for K and 0.58 V for Na. Thus, the nano-heterostructure can provide a theoretical storage capacity of 433 mAh/g and 580 mAh/g respectively for K and Na. Finally, the thermal stability of a fully potassiated/sodiated G/P system at room temperature is revealed by the ab-initio MolecularDynamics (AIMD) calculations.

Direct method and soft reaction conditions were employed to synthesis Merlinoite (Merl) in more than 100% yield related to CFA. Further, the Merl surface was modified by ZrO2+ through the microwave-assisted process at 130 degrees C for 5 min. Inductively coupled plasma confirmed the increase of Zr(IV) content up to 7.07 wt% while the potassium concentration decreased from 11.53 to 5.66 wt%, indicating the successful exchange in the Merl surface. The pristine Merl and its Zr@Merl were physicochemically characterized.

The adsorption behavior was explained by pseudo-second-order and Freundlich models. The maximum adsorbed amount was 67.72 mg g(-1). The results proved that the involved mechanisms for the phosphate sorption onto Zr@Merl were electrostatic attractions followed by coordination reactions. Further, a theoretical study using Monte Carlo/SA simulations was applied to get insight into the interaction between Merl and Zr@Merl surface groups and H2PO4- ions.

The study of soil organic matter included determination of carbon, fractionation of soil organic matter (SOM) and of sediment and carbon management index (CMI). The results showed that maintaining spontaneous vegetation/weeds intercropped with the olive trees olive trees offered improved soil protection, mainly regarding carbon stocks, because it presented CMI increase from 20.91 up to 48.0 from non-conservationist to more conservationist olive cultivation and should, therefore, be adopted. Losses of nutrients and carbon where the olive tree is maintained without intercropping reached high levels, proving to be an unsustainable practice.","['Water erosion', ' Spontaneous vegetation', ' Cover plants', ' Olea Europaea', ' Inceptisol', 'TILLAGE SYSTEM', ' CARBON', ' CLIMATE', ' CULTIVATION', ' FERTILITY', ' PASTURE', ' IMPACTS', ' BRAZIL', ' COSTS', ' YIELD']",2021.0,SOIL TILL RES,['Agriculture'],"['CAPES', 'CNPQ', 'FAPEMIG', ' Proex [5932018]', 'CAPES']",False,5,False,52
Boundaries in space and time: Iconic biases across modalities,"['Kuhn, J', ' Geraci, C', ' Schlenker, P', ' Strickland, B']","The idea that the form of a word reflects information about its meaning has its roots in Platonic philosophy, and has been experimentally investigated for concrete, sensory-based properties since the early 20th century. Here, we provide evidence for an abstract property of ?boundedness? that introduces a systematic, iconic bias on the phonological expectations of a novel lexicon. We show that this abstract property is general across events and objects. In Experiment 1, we show that subjects are systematically more likely to associate sign language signs that end with a gestural boundary with telic verbs (denoting events with temporal boundaries, e.g., die, arrive) and with count nouns (denoting objects with spatial boundaries, e.g., ball, coin). In Experiments 2?3, we show that this iconic mapping acts on conceptual representations, not on grammatical features. Specifically, the mapping does not carry over to psychological nouns (e.g. people are not more likely to associate a gestural boundary with idea than with knowledge). Although these psychological nouns are still syntactically encoded as either count or mass, they do not denote objects that are conceived of as having spatial boundaries. The mapping bias thus breaks down. Experiments 4?5 replicate these findings with a new set of stimuli. Finally, in Experiments 6?11, we explore possible extensions to a similar bias for spoken language stimuli, with mixed results. Generally, the results here suggest that ?boundedness? of words? referents (in space or time) has a powerful effect on intuitions regarding the form that the words should take.","['Language universals', ' Cognitive biases', ' Event and object boundaries', ' Sign language', ' Telicity', ' Count', ' mass']",2021.0,COGNITION,['Psychology'],"['FP', 'ERC', 'ENS']",False,3,False,74
Landfilling and composting efficiency to reduce genotoxic effect of petroleum sludge,"['Aguelmous, A', ' Zegzouti, Y', ' Khadra, A', ' El Fels, L', ' Souabi, S', ' Hafidi, M']","The main aim of the study was the investigation of the petroleum sludge genotoxic aspect by cost-effective way. Indeed, the work was done by assessing the micronuclei frequency (MN) and mitotic index (MI) using Vicia faba roots assay, after direct exposure in solid matrix. The petroleum sludge was highly cytotoxic as its MI was much less than the one of the positive control. The petroleum sludge exhibits a high genotoxic aspect in terms of MN (12.6%o) and MI (4.3%). Secondly, petroleum sludge was subjected to landfilling and composting treatments. These treatments have led to the organic matter biotransformation, as demonstrated by physicochemical analyses. This biotransformation was more noteworthy in the case of composting by the high decrease of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) concentration. The TPH removal rate was 60.6 and 93.7% for landfilling and composting treatments, respectively. The genotoxicity test confirmed more the biodegradation of toxic compound in the petroleum sludge by composting and landfilling treatments. This positive effect was assessed by the increase of the MI by 42.9% and 62.5% for landfilling and composting, respectively. On the other side, the MN decreased by 69.8% and 85.7% for landfilling and composting, respectively. However, the Vicia faba test revealed that the genotoxicity was not only due to the TPH concentration, but the specific TPH characteristics can play a significant role. Somehow, the Vicia faba assay is a short, low-cost, and effective test to assess the TPH genotoxic biodegradation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We have developed this framework as part of the Structure and Organisation of Governments Project, which aims to map entire central state bureaucracies in three Western European countries. Our approach is flexible enough to describe macro-trends in public sector organization populations and to explain these trends by analysing the event histories of the organizations they comprise. In addition to presenting our framework and how we applied it to create this data set, we also present some initial cross-national comparisons of the distribution of the event types recorded, highlighting initial findings and promising avenues for further research. Points for practitioners We present here a novel approach for representing the structural changes that organizations and sub-departments experience over time that can apply to any hierarchical organization (public or private). Applying the approach illuminates the historical development of organizations and their parts, and allows cross-national comparisons of events and trends across organizations.

Consequently, an efficient way to determine the flow induced fiber orientation for different flow cases under real injection molding conditions is presented. The proposed approach allows the average orientation angle prediction in a section by considering the close interaction between the fibers and the flow rheology, the fibers aspect ratio and the mold geometry.

Implementing a new texture-based soil evaporation reduction coefficient in the FAO dual crop coefficient method,"['Amazirh, A', ' Merlin, O', ' Er-Raki, S', ' Bouras, E', ' Chehbouni, A']","Crop evapotranspiration (ET) is a fundamental component of the hydrological cycle, especially in arid/semi-arid regions. The FAO-56 offers an operational method for deriving ET from the reduction (dual crop coefficient Kc) of the atmospheric evaporative demand (ET0). The dual coefficient approach (FAO-2Kc) is intended to improve the daily estimation of ET by separating the contribution of bare soil evaporation (E) and crop transpiration components. The FAO-2Kc has been a well-known reference for the operational monitoring of crop water needs. However, its performance for estimating the water use efficiency is limited by uncertainties in the modeled evaporation/transpiration partitioning. This paper aims at improving the soil module of the FAO-2Kc by modifying the E reduction coefficient (Kr) according to soil texture information and state-of-the-art formulations, hence, to amend the mismatch between FAO-2Kc and field-measured data beyond standard conditions. In practice this work evaluates the performance of two evaporation models, using the classical Kr (Kr,FAO) and a new texture-based Kr (Kr,text) over 33 bare soil sites under different evaporative demand and soil conditions. An offline validation is investigated by forcing both models with observed soil moisture (?s) data as input. The Kr,text methodology provides more accurate E estimations compared to the Kr,FAO method and systematically reduces biases. Using Kr,text allows reaching the lowest root means square error (RMSE) of 0.16 mm/day compared to the Kr,FAO where the lowest RMSE reached is 0.88 mm/day. As a step further in the assessment of the proposed methodology, ET was estimated in three wheat fields across the entire agricultural season. Both approaches were thus inter-compared in terms of ET estimates forced by SM estimated as a residual of the water balance model (online validation). Compared to ET measurements, the new formulation provided more accurate results. The RMSE was 0.66 mm/day (0.71 mm/day) and the R2 was 0.83 (0.78) for the texture-based (classical) Kr.","['FAO-2Kc', ' Soil evaporation', ' Soil texture', ' Soil moisture', ' Evapotranspiration']",2021.0,AGR WATER MANAGE,"['Agriculture', ' Water Resources']","['European Commission Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation, Spain (H2020) [645642, 823965]', 'MIXMOD']",False,2,False,67

Global Climate Pattern Impacts on Long-Term Olive Yields in Northwestern Africa: Case from Souss-Massa Region,"['Abahous, H', ' Bouchaou, L', ' Chehbouni, A']","In arid to semi-arid regions, vulnerability to climate change combined with the overexploitation of water resources is jeopardizing food security. In the Souss-Massa region in central Morocco, the rural population relies on growing olives for a living. The management of these orchards is mostly traditional under rainfed irrigation, which induces a high level of dependence on climate variability. In the present study, we investigate the long-term trends of the relationship between the observed olive yields and global climate patterns during the period 1973-2014. We apply lagged Spearman's correlations and cross-wavelet analysis to detect the potential influence of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) on the yield variability of olive orchards. The results of a Mann-Kendall test show a statistically significant decreasing trend in olive yields during the studied period. Statistically significant negative correlations were observed for (lag = -1) with spring and summer NINO 3.4 and with summer and autumn PDO. No statistically significant correlations between olive yields and NAO and IOD were observed. The results of wavelet coherence between annual olive yields and PDO and ENSO revealed that the highest values of power spectrum coherence occurred during the (lag = 0) spring PDO and (lag = -1) spring ENSO, both with an antiphase relationship.

AO extraction technology has evolved to meet the market demand. However artisanal production is still widely practiced. The present study aimed at highlighting the influence of water quality on the physicochemical and sensory properties of artisanally extracted AO. To meet this objective, AO was prepared using various water types namely: well water (AOWW), tap water (AOTW), mineral water (AOMW), distilled water (AODW), and ultra-pure water (AOUW). The obtained AOs were evaluated in terms of routinely measured quality indices: iodine, peroxide, acidity, and anisidine values, UV specific extinction coefficients, refraction index, and moisture content. Chemical composition (fatty acids, sterols content, and tocopherols content) was investigated together with oxidative stability (OS) and sensory properties. As revealed by the statistical test used, water quality impacted significantly mainly on AO chemical composition, OS, and sensory properties. Obtained results of almost studied quality attributes were consistent with the Official Moroccan Norm. The greatest values of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were recorded in AOMW and OAWW, respectively, while AOUW together with AOTW displayed the best record of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, the highest values of tocopherols were found in AOTW and AOUW. AODW and AOUW presented greatest values of sterols content, OS, and shelf life. Likewise, sensory analysis was satisfactory in almost obtained AOs. Principal component analysis confirmed these results and allowed a good separation among AOs especially with sterols and tocopherols.

"An evapotranspiration model self-calibrated from remotely sensed surface soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation cover fraction: application to disaggregated SMOS and MODIS data","['Hssaine, BA', ' Merlin, O', ' Ezzahar, J', ' Ojha, N', ' Er-Raki, S', ' Khabba, S']","Thermal-based two-source energy balance modeling is essential to estimate the land evapotranspiration (ET) in a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the use of thermal-derived land surface temperature (LST) is not sufficient to simultaneously constrain both soil and vegetation flux components. Therefore, assumptions (about either soil or vegetation fluxes) are commonly required. To avoid such assumptions, an energy balance model, TSEB-SM, was recently developed by Ait Hssaine et al. (2018b) in order to consider the microwave-derived near-surface soil moisture (SM), in addition to the thermal-derived LST and vegetation cover fraction (f(c)) normally used. While TSEB-SM has been successfully tested using in situ measurements, this paper represents its first evaluation in real life using 1 km resolution satellite data, comprised of MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) for LST and f(c) data and 1 km resolution SM data disaggregated from SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) observations. The approach is applied during a 4-year period (2014-2018) over a rainfed wheat field in the Tensift basin, central Morocco. The field used was seeded for the 2014-2015 (S1), 2016-2017 (S2) and 2017-2018 (S3) agricultural seasons, while it remained unploughed (as bare soil) during the 2015-2016 (B1) agricultural season. The classical TSEB model, which is driven only by LST and f(c) data, significantly overestimates latent heat fluxes (LE) and underestimates sensible heat fluxes (H) for the four seasons. The overall mean bias values are 119, 94, 128 and 181 W m(-2) for LE and -104, -71, -128 and -181 W m(-2) for H, for S1, S2, S3 and B1, respectively. Meanwhile, when using TSEB-SM (SM and LST combined data), these errors are significantly reduced, resulting in mean bias values estimated as 39, 4, 7 and 62 W m(-2) for LE and -10, 24, 7, and -59 W m(-2) for H, for S1, S2, S3 and B1, respectively. Consequently, this finding confirms again the robustness of the TSEB-SM in estimating latent/sensible heat fluxes at a large scale by using readily available satellite data. In addition, the TSEB-SM approach has the original feature to allow for calibration of its main parameters (soil resistance and Priestley-Taylor coefficient) from satellite data uniquely, without relying either on in situ measurements or on a priori parameter values.","['HIGH SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOLUTION', ' ENERGY FLUXES', ' WATER-STRESS', ' WHEAT CROP', ' EVAPORATIVE FRACTION', ' DIURNAL BEHAVIOR', ' SENSING DATA', ' HEAT-FLUX', ' MICROWAVE', ' RETRIEVAL']",2020.0,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,"['Geology', ' Water Resources']","['European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [645642, 823965]', 'CHAAMS', 'MIXMOD', 'PHC', 'IRD']",False,5,False,85
Irrigation retrieval from Landsat optical/thermal data integrated into a crop water balance model: A case study over winter wheat fields in a semi-arid region,"['Olivera-Guerra, L', ' Merlin, O', ' Er-Raki, S']","Monitoring irrigation is essential for an efficient management of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions. We propose to estimate the timing and the amount of irrigation throughout the agricultural season using optical and thermal Landsat-7/8 data. The approach is implemented in four steps: i) partitioning the Landsat land surface temperature (LST) to derive the crop water stress coefficient (Ks), ii) estimating the daily root zone soil moisture (RZSM) from the integration of Landsat-derived Ks into a crop water balance model, iii) retrieving irrigation at the Landsat pixel scale and iv) aggregating pixel-scale irrigation estimates at the crop field scale. The new irrigation retrieval method is tested over three agricultural areas during four seasons and is evaluated over five winter wheat fields under different irrigation techniques (drip, flood and no-irrigation). The model is very accurate for the seasonal accumulated amounts (R similar to 0.95 and RMSE similar to 44 mm). However, lower agreements with observed irrigations are obtained at the daily scale. To assess the performance of the irrigation retrieval method over a range of time periods, the daily predicted and observed irrigations are cumulated from 1 to 90 days. Generally, acceptable errors (R = 0.52 and RMSE = 27 mm) are obtained for irrigations cumulated over 15 days and the performance gradually improves by increasing the accumulation period, depicting a strong link to the frequency of Landsat overpasses (16 days or 8 days by combining Landsat-7 and -8). Despite the uncertainties in retrieved irrigations at daily to weekly scales, the daily RZSM and evapotranspiration simulated from the retrieved daily irrigations are estimated accurately and are very close to those estimated from actual irrigations. This research demonstrates the utility of high spatial resolution optical and thermal data for estimating irrigation and consequently for better closing the water budget over agricultural areas. We also show that significant improvements can be expected at daily to weekly time scales by reducing the revisit time of high-spatial resolution thermal data, as included in the TRISHNA future mission requirements.","['Irrigation', ' Land surface temperature', ' FAO-56 model', ' Landsat', ' Root-zone soil moisture', ' Evapotranspiration', 'SURFACE SOIL-MOISTURE', ' HIGH SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOLUTION', ' TIME-SERIES', ' MONITORING EVAPOTRANSPIRATION', ' TEMPERATURE RETRIEVAL', ' SENTINEL-1 RADAR', ' AREA', ' DISAGGREGATION', ' ALGORITHM', ' INDEX']",2020.0,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,"['Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Remote Sensing', ' Imaging Science & Photographic Technology']","['European Commission Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation (H2020) [645642, 823965]', 'CONICYT']",False,2,False,69

Temperature Effect on Ragone Plots of Lithium-Ion Batteries,"['Kumar, SK', ' Abduh, AABM', ' Sabih, O', ' Yazami, R']","Temperature is a major factor affecting lithium-ion batteries (LIB) performances including power, energy and life. Energy density vs. power density (E(P)) charts known as Ragone plots are convenient charts for comparing the performance of energy storage systems (ESS) such as batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, flywheels, hydrogen and gasoline. Basically, Ragone plots allow one to determine the amount of energy E (Wh kg(-1) and Wh l(-1)) an ESS may deliver under a constant power load P (W kg(-1) and W l(-1)). In this study Ragone charts are achieved on commercial LIB cells at temperatures ranging from -20 degrees C to + 55 degrees C. Cells are first charged using CCCV protocol at C/10 up to 4.2 V at the ambient temperatures (similar to 25 degrees C). Then cells are discharged isothermally at constant rates ranging from C/5 to 10 C. To account for varying power and temperature Ragone isotherms are integrated over the power range yielding a functional Integrated Energy-Power (2 root integral E-p(P)dP|(T)). The ratio of integrated areas at T and at 25 degrees C gives the Energy-Power Index (EPI) (%). The EPI vs. T profile shows a linear increase between -10 degrees C and 25 degrees C then it makes a semi-plateau between 25 degrees C and 55 degrees C. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

This investigation clearly shows the role of the SPI and the complexity of the redox reactions. Cobalt, nickel, and manganese are all electrochemically active upon cycling between 4.5 and 2.0V; all are in the 4+ state at the end of charging. Reduction to Co3+, Ni3+, and Mn3+ occurs upon discharging and, at low potential, there is partial reversible reduction to Co2+ and Ni2+.

Moreover, the removal of fouling potential in two-stage DMF (DMF pretreatment) was compared with the removal in two-stage DMF installed after dissolved air floatation (DAF) (DAF-DMF pretreatment). For this purpose, the silt density index (SDI), modified fouling index (MFI), bacterial growth potential (BGP), organic fractions and microbial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were monitored in the pretreatment processes of two full-scale SWRO plants. Particulate fouling potential was well controlled through the two stages of DMF with significant removal of SDI15 (>80%), MFI0.45 (94%) and microbial ATP (>95%). However, lower removal of biological/organic fouling potential (24-41%) was observed due to frequent chlorination (weekly) of the pretreatment, resulting in low biological activity in the DMFs. Therefore, neutralizing chlorine before media filtration is advised, rather than after, as is the current practice in many full-scale SWRO plants. Comparing overall removal in the DAF-DMF pretreatment to that of the DMF pretreatment showed that DAF improved the removal of biological/organic fouling potential, in which the removal of BGP and biopolymers increased by 40% and 16%, respectively. Overall, monitoring ATP and BGP during the pretreatment processes, particularly in DMF, would be beneficial to enhance biological degradation and lower biofouling potential in SWRO feed water.","['desalination', ' fouling potential', ' seawater reverse osmosis', ' pretreatment', ' seawater monitoring']",2021.0,MEMBRANES-BASEL,"['Biochemistry & Molecular Biology', ' Chemistry', ' Engineering', ' Materials Science', ' Polymer Science']",[''],False,1,False,46

Solid samples (PS and F-PS) were characterized physically, chemically and mineralogically. To maximize water recovery, thickening tests were performed on the PS using different flocculants to optimize flocculant concentration, the agitation speed and the settling time. Results showed that PS had positive surface charge since its paste pH (7.3) was lower than pHpzc (8.0), whereas the tested flocculant (Slim Floc used by the company) showed negative surface charge.

The highest stability of Sn(C=CPh)(4) allows the reaction in open-air, thereby reducing the cost of the synthesis and provides polymers with high molar mass. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and the long-term stability of the suspension PCL-g-GG in dichloromethane confirmed the effectiveness of grafting of PCL into GG. The size exclusion chromatography (SEC) results show that the molar masse of grafted PCL could be modulated by varying the amount of guar gum.

The current interest on biochar is linked to its long-term soil carbon sequestration, thus contributing to global warming mitigation. A parallel detailed screening of the physical and chemical properties of both solid-digestate and pyrochar was performed, inferring their effects on soil quality. Results showed that while P and K are enriched in pyrochar, total N showed no significant differences. Heavy metals revealed higher concentrations in pyrochar, but always largely below the biochar quality thresholds.

Assimilation of SMAP disaggregated soil moisture and Landsat land surface temperature to improve FAO-56 estimates of ET in semi-arid regions,"['Amazirh, A', ' Er-Raki, S', ' Ojha, N', ' Bouras, E', ' Rivalland, V', ' Merlin, O', ' Chehbouni, A']","Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is of crucial importance in water science and hydrological process understanding especially in semi-arid/arid areas since ET represents more than 85% of the total water budget. FAO-56 is one of the widely used formulations to estimate the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc (act)) due to its operational nature and since it represents a reasonable compromise between simplicity and accuracy. In this vein, the objective of this paper was to examine the possibility of improving ETc act estimates through remote sensing data assimilation. For this purpose, remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) and Land surface temperature (LST) data were simultaneously assimilated into FAO-dualK(c) . Surface SM observations were assimilated into the soil evaporation (E-s) component through the soil evaporation coefficient, and LST data were assimilated into the actual crop transpiration (T-c (act)) component through the crop stress coefficient. The LST data were used to estimate the water stress coefficient (K-s) as a proxy of LST (LST proxy ). The FAO-Ks was corrected by assimilating LST proxy derived from Landsat data based on the variances of predicted errors on K-s estimates from FAO-56 model and thermal-derived K-s. The proposed approach was tested over a semi-arid area in Morocco using first, in situ data collected during 2002-2003 and 2015-2016 wheat growth seasons over two different fields and then, remotely sensed data derived from disaggregated Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM and Landsat-LST sensors were used. Assimilating SM data leads to an improvement of the ETc act model prediction: the mot mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 0.98 to 0.65 mm/day compared to the classical FAO-dualK(c) using in situ SM. Moreover, assimilating both in situ SM and LST data provided more accurate results with a RMSE error of 0.55 mm/day.

As such, a fundamental question for any science of culture is, what ensures this stability in the first place? Here we focus on the evolutionary and stabilising role of `convergent transformation', in which one item causes the production of another item whose form tends to deviate from the original in a directed, non-random way. We present a series of stochastic models of cultural evolution investigating its effects. The results show that cultural stability can emerge and be maintained by virtue of convergent transformation alone, in the absence of any form of copying or selection process. We show how high-fidelity copying and convergent transformation need not be opposing forces, and can jointly contribute to cultural stability. We finally analyse how non-random transformation and high-fidelity copying can have different evolutionary signatures at population level, and hence how their distinct effects can be distinguished in empirical records. Collectively, these results supplement existing approaches to cultural evolution based on the Darwinian analogy, while also providing formal support for other frameworks such as Cultural Attraction Theory - that entail its further loosening.

Synergistic effect of Pseudomonas alkylphenolica PF9 and Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm41 on Moroccan alfalfa population grown under limited phosphorus availability,"['Farssi, O', ' Saih, R', ' Moukhtari, AE', ' Oubenali, A', ' Mouradi, M', ' Lazali, M', ' Ghoulam, C', ' Bouizgaren, A', ' Berrougui, H', ' Farissi, M']","This study looked at the synergistic effect of Pseudomonas alkylphenolica PF9 and Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm41 on the Moroccan alfalfa population (Oued Lmaleh) grown under symbiotic nitrogen fixation and limited phosphorus (P) availability. The experiment was conducted in a growth chamber and after two weeks of sowing, the young seedlings were inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm41 alone or combined with a suspension of Pseudomonas alkylphenolica PF9. Then, the seedlings were submitted to limited available P (insoluble P using Ca3HPO4) versus a soluble P form (KH2PO4) at a final concentration of 250 mu mol P.plant-1.week-1. After two months of P stress, the experiment was evaluated through some agro-physiological and biochemical parameters. The results indicated that the inoculation of alfalfa plants with Sinorhizobium strain alone or combined with Pseudomonas strain significantly (p < 0.001) improved the plant growth, the physiological and the biochemical traits focused in comparison to the uninoculated and P-stressed plants. For most sets of parameters, the improvement was more obvious in plants co-inoculated with both strains than in those inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm41 alone. In fact, under limited P-availability, the co-inoculation with two strains significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the growth of alfalfa plants evaluated by fresh and dry biomasses, plant height and leaf area. The results indicated also that the enhancement noted in plant growth was positively correlated with the shoot and root P contents. Furthermore, the incensement in plant P contents in response to bacterial inoculation improved cell membrane stability, reflected by low malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and electrolyte leakage (EL) contents, and photosynthetic-related parameters such as chlorophyll contents, the maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm) and stomatal conductance (gs). Our findings suggest that Pseudomonas alkylphenolica PF9 can act synergistically with Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm41 in promoting alfalfa growth under low-P availability.

"Vulnerability of maize, millet, and rice yields to growing season precipitation and socio-economic proxies in Cameroon","['Epule, TE', ' Chehbouni, A', ' Dhiba, D', ' Etongo, D', ' Driouech, F', ' Brouziyne, Y', ' Peng, C']","In sub-Saharan Africa growing season precipitation is affected by climate change. Due to this, in Cameroon, it is uncertain how some crops are vulnerable to growing season precipitation. Here, an assessment of the vulnerability of maize, millet, and rice to growing season precipitation is carried out at a national scale and validated at four sub-national scales/sites. The data collected were historical yield, precipitation, and adaptive capacity data for the period 1961-2019 for the national scale analysis and 1991-2016 for the sub-national scale analysis. The crop yield data were collected for maize, millet, and rice from FAOSTAT and the global yield gap atlas to assess the sensitivity both nationally and sub-nationally. Historical data on mean crop growing season and mean annul precipitation were collected from a collaborative database of UNDP/Oxford University and the climate portal of the World Bank to assess the exposure both nationally and sub-nationally. To assess adaptive capacity, literacy, and poverty rate proxies for both the national and regional scales were collected from KNOEMA and the African Development Bank. These data were analyzed using a vulnerability index that is based on sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. The national scale results show that millet has the lowest vulnerability index while rice has the highest. An inverse relationship between vulnerability and adaptive capacity is observed. Rice has the lowest adaptive capacity and the highest vulnerability index. Sub-nationally, this work has shown that northern maize is the most vulnerable crop followed by western highland rice. This work underscores the fact that at different scales, crops are differentially vulnerable due to variations in precipitation, temperature, soils, access to farm inputs, exposure to crop pest and variations in literacy and poverty rates. Therefore, caution should be taken when transitioning from one scale to another to avoid generalization. Despite these differences, in the sub-national scale, western highland rice is observed as the second most vulnerable crop, an observation similar to the national scale observation.","['SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA', ' CLIMATE-CHANGE', ' CROP PRODUCTION', ' RESILIENCE', ' DROUGHT', ' VARIABILITY', ' POVERTY', ' TRENDS']",2021.0,PLOS ONE,['Science & Technology - Other Topics'],['VI'],False,1,True,61

Therefore, it is aimed to highlight the potential uses of these materials based on their chemical and mineralogical compositions as well as their thermal behavior. Based on the obtained results, those waste materials turn out to offer a great potential for various industrial applications: traditional ceramics, cement industry, geopolymer, alkali activated materials, and acid mine drainage control. Their high content in carbonates could be exploited to produce light weight ceramic products with good acoustic and thermal insulation. Also, due to the high content of CaO, SiO2 and Al2O3, some samples could be mixed with some additives to serve as clinker raw materials or as supplementary cementitious materials. Additionally, high carbonates content provides high neutralization potential to stabilize acid generating tailings.

Integrating thermal stress indexes within Shuttleworth-Wallace model for evapotranspiration mapping over a complex surface,"['Elfarkh, J', ' Er-Raki, S', ' Ezzahar, J', ' Chehbouni, A', ' Aithssaine, B', ' Amazirh, A', ' Khabba, S', ' Jarlan, L']","The main goal of this work was to evaluate the potential of the Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW) model for mapping actual crop evapotranspiration (ET) over complex surface located in the foothill of the Atlas Mountain (Morocco). This model needs many input variables to compute soil (r(s)(s)) and vegetation (r(s)(v)) resistances, which are often difficult to estimate at large scale particularly soil moisture. In this study, a new approach to spatialize r(s)(s) and r(s)(v) based on two thermal-based proxy variables was proposed. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat data were combined with the endmember temperatures for soil (Ts-min and Ts-max) and vegetation (Tv(min) and Tv(max)), which were simulated by a surface energy balance model, to compute the soil (Ts) and the vegetation (Tv) temperatures. Based on these temperatures, two thermal proxies (SIss for soil and SIsv for vegetation) were calculated and related to r(s)(s) and r(s)(v), with an empirical exponential relationship [with a correlation coefficient (R) of about 0.6 and 0.5 for soil and vegetation, respectively]. The proposed approach was initially evaluated at a local scale, by comparing the results to observations by an eddy covariance system installed over an area planted with olive trees intercropped with wheat. In a second step, the new approach was applied over a large area which contains a mixed vegetation (tall and short) crossed by a river to derive r(s)(s) and r(s) (v), and thereafter to estimate ET. A Large aperture scintillometer (LAS) installed over a line transect of 1.4 km and spanning the total area was used to validate the obtained ET.

A Simple Light-Use-Efficiency Model to Estimate Wheat Yield in the Semi-Arid Areas,"['Khabba, S', ' Er-Raki, S', ' Toumi, J', ' Ezzahar, J', ' Hssaine, BA', ' Le Page, M', ' Chehbouni, A']","In this study, a simple model, based on a light-use-efficiency model, was developed in order to estimate growth and yield of the irrigated winter wheat under semi-arid conditions. The originality of the proposed method consists in (1) the modifying of the expression of the conversion coefficient (epsilon(conv)) by integrating an appropriate stress threshold (k(sconv)) for triggering irrigation, (2) the substitution of the product of the two maximum coefficients of interception (epsilon(imax)) and conversion (epsilon(conv_max)) by a single parameter epsilon(max), (3) the modeling of epsilon(max) as a function of the Cumulative Growing Degree Days (CGDD) since sowing date, and (4) the dynamic expression of the harvest index (HI) as a function of the CGDD and the final harvest index (HI0) depending on the maximum value of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The calibration and validation of the proposed model were performed based on the observations of wheat dry matter (DM) and grain yield (GY) which were collected on the R3 irrigated district of the Haouz plain (center of Morocco), during three agricultural seasons. Further, the outputs of the simple model were also evaluated against the AquaCrop model estimates. The model calibration allowed the parameterization of epsilon(max) in four periods according to the wheat phenological stages. By contrast, a linear evolution was sufficient to represent the relationship between HI and CGDD. For the model validation, the obtained results showed a good agreement between the estimated and observed values with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of about 1.07 and 0.57 t/ha for DM and GY, respectively. These correspond to a relative RMSE of about 19% for DM and 20% for GY. Likewise, although of its simplicity, the accuracy of the proposed model seems to be comparable to that of the AquaCrop model. For GY, R-2, and RMSE values were respectively 0.71 and 0.44 t/ha for the developed approach and 0.88 and 0.37 t/ha for AquaCrop.

A Fast-Tracking Hybrid MPPT Based on Surface-Based Polynomial Fitting and P&O Methods for Solar PV under Partial Shaded Conditions,"['Gonzalez-Castano, C', ' Restrepo, C', ' Revelo-Fuelagan, J', ' Lorente-Leyva, LL', ' Peluffo-Ordonez, DH']","The efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems depends directly on solar irradiation, so drastic variations in solar exposure will undoubtedly move its maximum power point (MPP). Furthermore, the presence of partial shading conditions (PSCs) generates local maximum power points (LMPPs) and one global maximum power point (GMPP) in the P-V characteristic curve. Therefore, a proper maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is crucial to increase PV system efficiency. There are classical, intelligent, optimal, and hybrid MPPT techniques; this paper presents a novel hybrid MPPT technique that combines Surface-Based Polynomial Fitting (SPF) and Perturbation and Observation (P & O) for solar PV generation under PSCs. The development of the experimental PV system has two stages: (i) Modeling the PV array with the DC-DC boost converter using a real-time and high-speed simulator (PLECS RT Box), (ii) and implementing the proposed GMPPT algorithm with the double-loop controller of the DC-DC boost converter in a commercial low-priced digital signal controller (DSC). According to the simulation and the experimental results, the suggested hybrid algorithm is effective at tracking the GMPP under both uniform and nonuniform irradiance conditions in six scenarios: (i) system start-up, (ii) uniform irradiance variations, (iii) sharp change of the (PSCs), (iv) multiple peaks in the P-V characteristic, (v) dark cloud passing, and (vi) light cloud passing. Finally, the experimental results-through the standard errors and the mean power tracked and tracking factor scores-proved that the proposed hybrid SPF-P & O MPPT technique reaches the convergence to GMPP faster than benchmark approaches when dealing with PSCs.","['maximum power point tracking', ' photovoltaic system', ' partial shading conditions', ' surface-based polynomial fitting', 'POWER POINT TRACKING', ' SYSTEMS', ' ALGORITHM', ' OPTIMIZATION']",2021.0,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,['Mathematics'],['ANID'],False,1,False,30

Basins of attraction around large cities-A study of urban interaction spaces in Europe,"['Dziecielski, M', ' Kourtit, K', ' Nijkamp, P', ' Ratajczak, W']","The geographic dispersion and size distribution of cities seem, at first glance, to exhibit a random pattern. Clearly, physical geography, geo-political history and climatology shape irregular constraints and forms in the global pattern of urban evolution, so that an entirely regular spatial picture of cities and their interactions in space is not plausible. In the history of urban geography, regional science and spatial planning, several attempts have been undertaken to identify or derive organised or stylised structures in the seemingly chaotic system of real-world settlements. Examples are Central Place Theory, the Tinbergen-Bos models of hierarchical spatial systems, or Tellier's topo-dynamic corridors. The present paper seeks to offer a stylised and quantitative depiction of the relative spatial positions and spheres of influence of 14 large European cities in a geo-gravitational force field, based on detailed data on an extensive set of multidimensional indicators from the multi-annual GPCI (Global Power City Index) data set. Assuming an interconnected urban network, the paper tests and maps out the existence of gravitational interactions between urban agglomerations by producing impact fields of spatial attractors (basins of attraction) in the European urban system. This approach forms an illustration of the emerging Systemic Economic Geography (SEG). Given the multi-annual nature of our data, we address particularly the complex urban field dynamics using the principle of gravitational interactions. The dynamics of individual urban agglomerations is calculated and mapped out using Newton's second law of motion for a study on fractal geometry. This 'neo-Newtonian' approach is able to trace spatial spheres of influence of urban agglomerations, while the underlying algorithm allows to test the factors responsible for spatial resistance or geographic frictions. In this way, we can delineate the contours of a stylised map for the gravitational fields of cities with different size, distance frictions and geographical locations. The paper addresses in particular the effect of generalized friction parameters for a set of pluriform urban key characteristics on the gravitational urban arena in Europe. It turns out that size, relative spatial position, spatial friction and multidimensional urban moderator variables are responsible for the emergence of a complex and often disorganised urban spatial interaction field. Our analysis frames in a nutshell the principles of spatial attractors in the urban geography of our world, and of Europe in particular.

This work aimed to determine the influence of anthropization on trace and major element concentrations and to assess how it might also affect soil biochemical and microbiological parameters in an urban area of Marrakech city, Morocco. Materials and methods The work was carried out on nine topsoils located along an anthropogenic gradient from a suburban area to the city center. The percentage of technogenic fraction (TGF) (e.g., building material, plastic, wood, metallic material, bones, glass, paper, fabric) was used to quantify the degree of human interference in the different soils. Physicochemical parameters were measured: pH (in water solution), TOC (Anne method), TKN, and Olsen phosphorus. The total fraction of trace and major elements (ISO NF 11446) and their water-soluble fraction were analyzed with an ICP-OES. Enumeration of cultivable microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes) was conducted on culture media. Dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and urease activities were colorimetrically measured, and the structure and diversity of soil bacterial communities were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. Results and discussion In general, trace and major element concentrations showed increasing levels along the anthropogenic gradient, except for Ca, Mg, B, and Cd. However, trace element concentrations remained below the standard international limits for soils. Total numbers of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes) varied significantly among sites, with bacterial counts directly related to the anthropogenic gradient, significantly increasing from suburban area to the city center. Dehydrogenase activity decreased throughout the anthropogenic gradient, while phosphatase and urease activities varied between sites independently of the gradient. DGGE profiles showed that bacterial diversity was higher in the most anthropized soils, where their community structure seemed to be influenced by the total concentrations of Zn, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and the technogenic fraction. Conclusions Overall, trace and major element concentrations and the technogenic fraction were higher with increasing levels of urbanization. Microbiological and biochemical parameters appeared significantly influenced by the anthropogenic inputs without being systematically inhibited along the anthropogenic gradient. Dehydrogenase activity decreased along the anthropization gradient, and thus may be used as a proxy to assess the effect of anthropization on soil biological functions.","['Ecosystem services', "" SUITMA's soils"", ' Metal contamination', ' Soil enzymes', ' Technogenic fraction', ' Technogenic soils', 'HEAVY-METAL CONTAMINATION', ' ORGANIC-CARBON STOCKS', ' INDUSTRIAL LAND USES', ' BACTERIAL COMMUNITY', ' GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS', ' BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY', ' TECHNIC MATERIALS', ' WASTE-WATER', ' DIVERSITY', ' POLLUTION']",2019.0,J SOIL SEDIMENT,"['Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Agriculture']","['SOE', 'FEDER']",False,2,False,91

Depending on their associated metallic content, surficial oxic to suboxic sediments could constitute a major source of metals. To identify the key parameters that control metallic elements in terms of their mobility and sensitivity to reservoir management, sediments were subject to resuspension and drying/wetting cycle experiments over a wide range of pH values, solid/liquid ratios (S/L) and redox (Eh) conditions. During these tests, special attention was also paid to the influence of pretreatments on samples, i.e., drying, aeration and the leachate composition (ultrapure water vs. natural water); on the preservation of the sediment characteristics; and especially on metallic element release. The results of this study show that the pH, S/L ratio and Eh parameters are key variables in metal solubilization; the pH influences metal mobility primarily through sorption-desorption phenomena as well as the dissolution of metallic-bearing phases, the S/L ratio modifies the sorption-desorption equilibria, and the Eh primarily affects the reducible sensitive phases and associated metallic elements through dissolution-precipitation processes. Under environmental conditions, evolution of these parameters can lead to a > 20% solubilization of the most mobile elements, i.e.,As and Cd. These results are influenced by the sample pretreatment and experimental conditions. In fact, even if the solubilization patterns show no significant differences between dry and wet sediment depending on the physicochemical conditions, the magnitude of their release is significantly affected. Drying pretreatment induces changes in metal speciation, notably altering the distribution of the most weakly bound elements; there is almost half the amount of metallic elements associated with the exchangeable fraction in dry compared to wet sediments. The solubilization percentages were higher in the ultrapure phase than in reservoir water primarily due to the low pH, which influenced the sorption equilibria. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Physico-mechanical properties of plywood bonded with ecological adhesives from Acacia mollissima tannins and lignosulfonates,"['Rhazi, N', ' Oumam, M', ' Sesbou, A', ' Hannache, H', ' Charrier-El Bouhtoury, F']","The objective of this research was to develop ecological adhesives for bonding plywood panels using lignosulfonates, a common waste product of the wood pulp industry, and natural tannin extracted from Moroccan bark of Acacia mollissima using different process. Natural tannin and lignin were used in wood adhesives formulation to substitute resins based on phenol and formaldehyde. To achieve this, the lignosulfonates were glyoxalated to enhance their reactivity and the used tannins obtained by three different extraction methods were compared with commercial mimosa tannin. The proportion of Acacia mollissima tannins and lignosulfonates, the pressing time, the pressing temperature, and the pressure used were studied to improve mechanical properties, and bonding quality of plywood panel. The properties of plywood panels produced with these adhesives were tested in accordance with normative tests. Thus, the tensile strength, and the shear strength were measured.

"Nutritional Quality, Voluntary Intake and Enteric Methane Emissions of Diets Based on Novel Cayman Grass and Its Associations With Two Leucaena Shrub Legumes","['Gaviria-Uribe, X', ' Bolivar, DM', ' Rosenstock, TS', ' Molina-Botero, IC', ' Chirinda, N', ' Barahona, R', ' Arango, J']","Methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation in cattle are an important source of greenhouse gases, accounting for about 40% of all agricultural emissions. Diet quality plays a fundamental role in determining the magnitude of CH4 emissions. Specifically, the inclusion of feeds with high digestibility and nutritional value have been reported to be a viable option for reducing CH4 emissions and, simultaneously, increase animal productivity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the nutritional composition and voluntary intake of diets based on tropical forages upon CH4 emissions from zebu steers. Five treatments (diets) were evaluated: Cay1: Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman (harvested after 65 days of regrowth: low quality); Cay2: cv. Cayman harvested after 45 days of regrowth; CayLl: cv. Cayman + Leucaena leucocephala; CayLd: cv. Cayman + Leucaena diversifolia; Hay: Dichantium aristatum hay as a comparator of common naturalized pasture. For each diet representing different levels of intensification (naturalized pasture, improved pasture, and silvopastoral systems), CH4 emissions were measured using the polytunnel technique with four zebu steers housed in individual chambers. The CH4 accumulated was monitored using an infrared multigas analyzer, and the voluntary forage intake of each animal was calculated. Dry matter intake (DMI, % of body weight) ranged between 0.77 and 2.94 among diets offered. Emissions of CH4 per kg of DMI were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in Cay1 (60.4 g), compared to other treatments. Diets that included Leucaena forage legumes had generally higher crude protein contents and higher DMI. Cay1 and Hay which had low protein content and digestibility had a higher CH4 emission intensity (per unit live weight gain) compared to Cay2, CayLl and CayLd. Our results suggest that grass consumed after a regrowth period of 45 days results in lower CH4 emissions intensities compared to those observed following a regrowth period of 65 days. Diets with Leucaena inclusion showed advantages in nutrient intake that are reflected in greater live weight gains of cattle. Consequently, the intensity of the emissions generated in the legume-based systems were lower suggesting that they are a good option for achieving the emission reduction goals of sustainable tropical cattle production.","['climate change mitigation', ' forage diversification', ' greenhouse gases', ' livestock', ' urochloa hybrid pastures', 'INTENSIVE SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEMS', ' NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS', ' ENERGY-UTILIZATION', ' FEED-INTAKE', ' DAIRY-COWS', ' CATTLE', ' FORAGE', ' DIGESTION', ' DIGESTIBILITY', ' LEUCOCEPHALA']",2020.0,FRONT VET SCI,['Veterinary Sciences'],"['BBSRC', 'GROW', 'BBSRCUK']",False,3,False,85

Grain yield gains and associated traits in tropical x temperate maize germplasm under high and low plant density,"['Ndou, V', ' Gasura, E', ' Chivenge, P', ' Derera, J']","Development of ideal breeding and crop management strategies that can improve maize grain yield under tropical environments is crucial. In the temperate regions, such yield improvements were achieved through use of genotypes that are adapted to high plant population density stress. However, tropical germplasm has poor tolerance to high plant population density stress, and thus it should be improved by introgressing temperate maize germplasm. The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic gains and identify traits associated with such gains in stable and high yielding temperate x tropical hybrids under low and high plant population densities. A total of 200 hybrids derived from a line x tester mating design of tropical x temperate germplasm were developed. These hybrids were evaluated for grain yield and allied traits under varied plant population densities. High yielding and stable hybrids, such as 15XH214, 15XH215 and 15XH121, were resistant to lodging and had higher number of leaves above the cob. The high genetic gains of 26% and desirable stress tolerance indices of these hybrids made them better performers over check hybrids under high plant population density. At high plant population density yield was correlated to stem lodging and number of leaves above the cob. Future gains in grain yield of these hybrids derived from temperate x tropical maize germplasm can be achieved by exploiting indirect selection for resistance to stem lodging and increased number of leaves above the cob under high plant density conditions.","['Adaptability', ' Genetic gains', ' Maize population density', ' Indirect selection', ' Root and stem lodging', 'SELECTION', ' CORN', ' ADAPTATION', ' HYBRIDS', ' STRESS', ' LINES', ' HEAT']",2021.0,EUPHYTICA,"['Agriculture', ' Plant Sciences']",['National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa'],False,1,False,40

For this purpose, sludge alone and mixed with olive pomace or macroalgal residues were subjected to anaerobic digestion with and without alkaline pretreatment. In addition, co-digestion of pretreated sludge with raw substrates was also carried out and compared to the whole mixture pretreatment. KOH pretreatment enhanced methane production by 39%, 15% and 49% from sludge, sludge mixed with olive pomace and sludge mixed with macroalgal residues, respectively. The digestates were characterised according to their physico-chemical and agronomic properties. They were then applied as biofertilizers for tomato growth during the first vegetative stage (28 days of culture). Concentrations in chlorophyll a and carotenoids in tomato plants, following sludge digestate addition, rose by 46% and 41% respectively. Sludge digestate enhanced tomato plant dry weight by 87%, while its nitrogen content increased by 90%. The impact of nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the digestate was strongest on tomato plant dry weight, thus explaining the efficiency of sludge digestate relative to other types of digestate.

Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions in agronomic soil, under two P levels: 10.4 mg P kg(-1) (deficient) and 30.4 mg P kg(-1) (sufficient), and two watering regimes: 40% of soil field capacity (FC; water deficit) against 80% FC (control). We hypothesis that P fertilization improves the tolerance of faba bean plants and their symbiosis to water deficit. The results demonstrated that water deficit and P-deficiency treatments applied separately or combined reduced substantially plant biomass, leaf water parameters, and nitrate reductase activity. Similarly, nutrients concentrations were significantly reduced under P-deficiency, while sufficient P-conditions significantly increased their uptake under water deficit. The tolerance was positively correlated to the ability of plants to overcome the combined stressors by inducing phosphatase activity, accumulating glycine betaine and activation of antioxidant enzymes and also by maintaining cell membrane stability.

Two backscattering models were selected in this study due to their wide use in inversion procedures: the theoretical integral equation model (IEM) and the semi-empirical model (Oh). To this end, the sensitivity of the SAR backscattering coefficients at VV (sigma vv degrees) and VH (sigma vh degrees) polarizations to in situ soil moisture data were analyzed first. As expected, the results showed that over bare soil the sigma vv degrees was well correlated with SSM compared to the sigma vh degrees, which showed more dispersion with correlation coefficients values (r) of about 0.84 and 0.61 for the VV and VH polarizations, respectively. Afterwards, these values of sigma vv degrees were compared to those simulated by the backscatter models. It was found that IEM driven by the measured length correlation L slightly underestimated SAR backscatter coefficients compared to the Oh model with a bias of about -0.7 dB and -1.2 dB and a root mean square (RMSE) of about 1.1 dB and 1.5 dB for Oh and IEM models, respectively. However, the use of an optimal value of L significantly improved the bias of IEM, which became near to zero, and the RMSE decreased to 0.9 dB. Then, a classical inversion approach of sigma vv degrees observations based on backscattering model is compared to a data driven retrieval technic (SVM). By comparing the retrieved soil moisture against ground truth measurements, it was found that results of SVM were very encouraging and were close to those obtained by IEM model.

A series of analyses and tests were carried out to demonstrate the nature, the surface functional groups and even the porosity of the resulting product. The activated carbon exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward catechol oxidation. The electron transfer coefficient, surface coverage and number of electrons for catechol oxidation at the surface of the AC-CPE were determined using electrochemical approaches.

"Performance Evaluation of the WOFOST Model for Estimating Evapotranspiration, Soil Water Content, Grain Yield and Total Above-Ground Biomass of Winter Wheat in Tensift Al Haouz (Morocco): Application to Yield Gap Estimation","['Dewenam, LEF', ' Er-Raki, S', ' Ezzahar, J', ' Chehbouni, A']","The main goal of this investigation was to evaluate the potential of the WOFOST model for estimating leaf area index (LAI), actual evapotranspiration (ETa), soil moisture content (SM), above-ground biomass levels (TAGP) and grain yield (TWSO) of winter wheat in the semi-arid region of Tensift Al Haouz, Marrakech (central Morocco). An application for the estimation of the Yield Gap is also provided. The model was firstly calibrated based on three fields data during the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 growing seasons, by using the WOFOST implementation in the Python Crop simulation Environment (PCSE) to optimize the different parameters that provide the minimum difference between the measured and simulated LAI, TAGP, TWSO, SM and ETa. Then, the model validation was performed based on the data from five other wheat fields. The results obtained showed a good performance of the WOFOST model for the estimation of LAI during both growing seasons on all validation fields. The average R-2, RSME and NRMSE were 91.4%, 0.57 m(2)/m(2), and 41.4%, respectively. The simulated ETa dynamics also showed a good agreement with the observations by eddy covariance systems. Values of 60% and 72% for R-2, 0.8 mm and 0.7 mm for RMSE, 54% and 31% for NRMSE are found for the two validation fields, respectively. The model's ability to predict soil moisture content was also found to be satisfactory; the two validation fields gave R-2 values equal to 48% and 49%, RMSE values equal to 0.03 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3), NRMSE values equal to 11% and 19%. The calibrated model had a medium performance with respect to the simulation of TWSO (R-2 = 42%, RSME = 512 kg/ha, NRMSE = 19%) and TAGP (R-2 = 34% and RSME = 936 kg/ha, NRMSE = 16%). After accurate calibration and validation of the WOFOST model, it was used for analyzing the gap yield since this model is able to estimate the potential yield. The WOFOST model allowed a good simulation of the potential yield (7.75 t/ha) which is close to the optimum value of 6.270 t/ha in the region. Yield gap analysis reveals a difference of 5.35 t/ha on average between the observed yields and the potential yields calculated by WOFOST. Such difference is ascribable to many factors such as the crop cycle management, agricultural practices such as water and fertilization supply levels, etc. The various simulations (irrigation scenarios) showed that early sowing is more adequate than late sowing in saving water and obtaining adequate grain yield. Based on various simulations, it has been shown that the early sowing (mid to late December) is more adequate than late sowing with a total amount of water supply of about 430 mm and 322 kg (140 kg of N, 80 kg of P and 102 kg of K) of fertilization to achieve the potential yield. Consequently, the WOFOST model can be considered as a suitable tool for quantitative monitoring of winter wheat growth in the arid and semi-arid regions.","['crop modelling', ' WOFOST', ' Tensift Morocco', ' evapotranspiration', ' crop yield estimation', ' soil moisture', ' leaf area index', ' total biomass', ' winter wheat', ' gap yield', 'LEAF-AREA INDEX', ' SIMULATION', ' SYSTEMS', ' COEFFICIENTS', ' IRRIGATION', ' CLIMATE', ' SERIES', ' CROPS']",2021.0,AGRONOMY-BASEL,"['Agriculture', ' Plant Sciences']",[''],False,1,False,50

Those oils were extracted from roasted and unroasted kernels. The EVAO shelf life assessment was made by determining chemical properties (acidity, peroxide value, specific absorbances K232 and K270, tocopherol content, fatty-acids and sterol composition, and oxidative stability index) and by FTIR spectra. Sixty EVAO samples (30 roasted and 30 unroasted) were evaluated after production and then were packed in two glass bottle types (dark and clear), which resulted in 120 samples. They were stored under realistic storage conditions (ambient temperature) for two successive years and analysed 6-monthly. Chemometric data analysis was applied to study the shelf-life influence. PCA and PLS-DA, on either the chemical data or the FTIR spectra, allowed the discrimination between fresh and oxidized oils. The oil shelf-life was predicted by means of PLS regression. Thus, the time of storage after which the oil loses its extra virgin quality could be predicted. Finally, the potential of FTIR fingerprinting to quantify four physicochemical properties (i.e. acidity, PV, K-232 and K-270) during EVAO storage was established using PLS regression.","['Extra virgin Argan oil', ' Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy', ' Oxidative stability', ' Shelf life', ' Storage degradability', ' Chemometric tools', 'TRANSFORM-INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY', ' OXIDATIVE STABILITY', ' CLASSIFICATION', ' PHYTOSTEROLS', ' TOCOPHEROLS', ' QUALITY']",2021.0,FOOD CONTROL,['Food Science & Technology'],"['FWO', 'VLIR', 'VI']",False,3,True,43

A field experiment was conducted during 2014 and 2015 to determine the effect of limited water on growth, yield, water productivity (WP), nutritive value, and physiological parameters of silage corn (Zea mays L.) grown in a semi-arid region. Hybrid 'P8107HR' was planted in replicated plots under 100ETc (100% crop evapotranspiration), 80ETc, 60ETc, and limited 100ETc (100ETc from planting to V9, no water from V9 to R3, then 100ETc again) managed with a surface drip irrigation. Canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), specific leaf area (SLA), biomass yield, WP, and nutritive value were determined. Photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), and intrinsic WP (iWP) were obtained with an infrared gas analyzer from V14 to R2 stages. Relative water content (RWC) of leaves was determined at V8, V12, VT, and R3 stages. Results showed that canopy height and biomass yield were greatly affected by water stress. Biomass yield decreased by 40% in the limited 100ETc treatment compared to 100ETc, with no effect of irrigation on nutritive value. Water-stressed plants from V14 to R2 were affected in their ability to perform gas exchange and exhibited changes in crop growth and biomass yield. RWC was affected by water stress, mostly under 60ETc at V8 (71%) and VT (78%). Overall, limited water at late vegetative and early reproductive stages affected physiology and yield of silage corn, indicating that irrigation timing is a key factor for optimizing silage corn production in water-scarce regions.","['ZEA-MAYS L.', ' USE EFFICIENCY', ' DEFICIT IRRIGATION', ' MAIZE', ' CROP', ' DROUGHT', ' PLANTS', ' YIELD', ' WHEAT', ' PHOTOSYNTHESIS']",2020.0,AGRON J,['Agriculture'],"['Department of Plant Sciences of the University of Wyoming', ' Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Wyoming']",False,2,False,62

Laboratory batch tests were performed using the main expected lithologies of phosphate materials in contact with synthetic AMD, which had a low pH (3.08) and contained high concentrations of Fe (600 mg/L), Mn (40 mg/L), Mg (10 mg/L), Zn (20 mg/L), Cu (25 mg/L), As (50 mg/L), and sulfate (3700 mg/L). Phosphate materials were used as an oxic limestone drain to evaluate the increase in the pH of the AMD and metal removal by sorption and precipitation mechanisms. The results showed that all phosphatic lithologies were efficient in the passive treatment of AMD. The pH rapidly increased from 3.08 to 8.47 during water-rock interactions. The neutralization potential comparisons also showed that the phosphatic limestone wastes neutralized more acid than other lithologies. In addition, metals were efficiently removed (95.5% to 99.9%) by all materials. The results of batch sorption tests showed that the concentrations of metals in residual leachates did not exceed the Algerian criteria for industrial liquid effluents. Overall, these findings indicate that passive systems using phosphatic materials from the Djebel Onk mine can be effective for AMD treatment. The use of these mine wastes for passive treatment of AMD would allow the development of integrated management strategies for these residual materials in the context of sustainable development of phosphate mining.

The PV modules are one of the important components in a PV plant. Thus, they should operate reliably and above 80% of their rated power output, for at least 25 years. Harsh climate, like the one in Morocco, affects the durability of the PV modules. This issue needs to be deeply investigated. In this paper, field degradation data of 76 modules, from four of the most used technologies in the market, have been measured and analysed after 3 years of outdoor exposition. Results show that the annual mean power degradation rates (Rd) over the operation period are as follows: 0.05%/y for Copper Indium Selenide (CIS), 2.21%/y for micro-morph and 2.6%/y for monocrystalline (m-Si). As for polycrystalline (p-Si), the Rd measured was of 1.45%/y and 3.41%/y depending on the manufacturer. This is the first study dealing with PV modules durability in Morocco, and we believe that these results will be useful for researchers and project developers to get an idea about the PV durability in Morocco, and to add the found Rd values into consideration in the projects prefeasibility study.

To put this new concept in context, we offer first a concise overview of related and complementary notions (e.g. happiness, satisfaction, well-being, quality of life, contentment). Then we propose a new departure for attractiveness research pertaining to micro-based information on residents or users of cities by introducing the notion of a 'city-love production function'. This function expresses the ability of cities to enhance the love or appreciation for a city or its neighbourhoods through an appropriate combination of five specific 'city capital' constituents. We test the validity of this so-called 'Pentagon' approach to city love by means of the city-love production function using a multivariate econometric model based on extensive heterogeneous statistical data on municipalities in Sweden and complemented with cell phone data. Our results are confronted with empirical 'big data' on the appreciation of Swedish places - and their characteristics - taken from social media platforms.

The oxidative VO2+ ions present in the charged positive electrolyte are the predominant stressor causing loss of functional groups and membrane conductivity. Membrane aging was accelerated in ex situ tests by exploiting elevated temperatures and the increased oxidative strength of Ce4+. Acceleration factors were determined on the basis of the analysis of aged radiation grafted g(S-AN) membranes. The degradation in a Ce4+ solution was found to be similar to 4 times faster than in VO2+. The highest acceleration factor of similar to 200 was found for the degradation with Ce4+ at 80 degrees C.

The applicability of the test was further evaluated with the second membrane, g(AMS-MAN). Its lifetime was estimated based on the accelerated stress test and acceleration factors previously determined for the g(S-AN) membrane and compared to the lifetime projected from an extended cycling experiment in the cell.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the changes in soil C and N stocks in livestock areas under pasture reclamation and contribute to the empirical basis for evaluating the ABC Plan. Based on the assessment of six chronosequences across Brazilian Cerrado, we observed that the effects of management practices for pasture reclamation on soil C and N stocks in livestock areas were quite variable. Any general tendencies depend on the depth evaluated. At the 0-30 cm soil layer, pasture areas under reclamation in Brazilian Cerrado showed an average soil C change rate of 0.47 Mg C ha(-1 )yr(-1). However, for the more in-depth assessment (0-100 cm), the adoption of management practices for pasture reclamation did not affect the average rate of soil C changes for these areas. In this sense, we suggest that an up-scaling from single case studies may lead to overestimations of soil C inventories. Thefore, ABC Plan must review some of its approaches based on general values and extrapolations regarding C sequestration in pasture areas.","['Soil C', ' pasture reclamation', ' greenhouse gases', ' Brazilian iNDC', ' soil organic matter', ' ABC Plan', 'SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON', ' LAND-USE CHANGE', ' GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS', ' GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT', ' STOCKS', ' CONVERSION', ' SUGARCANE', ' EXPANSION', ' STORAGE', ' AMAZON']",2021.0,CARBON MANAG,['Environmental Sciences & Ecology'],"['FAPESP', 'CNPQ', 'RCGI', 'FAPESP', ' Shell Brasil']",False,5,False,39

In this method, single targets based on Zn1-xVxO nanopowders prepared by the sol-gel process were used. Characterization of the Zn1-xVxO nanoparticles showed that they crystallize in the hexagonal wurtzite structure. Their size ranged from 20 to 40 nm. The effect of process parameters on the physical and chemical properties of Zn1-xVxO thin films has been studied. For x <= 0.30, the results obtained at 200 degrees C and 60 W indicate that the films have a high quality of crystallinity.

City intelligence for enhancing urban performance value: a conceptual study on data decomposition in smart cities,"['Kourtit, K']","The contemporary 'digital age' prompts the need for a re-assessment of urban planning principles and practices. Against the background of current data-rich urban planning, this study seeks to address the question whether an appropriate methodological underpinning can be provided for smart city governance based on a data-driven planning perspective. It posits that the current digital technology age has a drastic impact on city strategies and calls for a multi-faceted perspective on future urban development, termed here the 'XXQ-principle' (which seeks to attain the highest possible level of quality for urban life). Heterogeneity in urban objectives and data embodied in the XXQ-principle can be systematically addressed by a process of data decomposition (based on a 'cascade principle'), so that first, higher-level urban policy domains are equipped with the necessary ('big') data provisions, followed by lower-ranking urban governance levels. The conceptual decomposition principle can then be translated into a comprehensive hierarchical model architecture for urban intelligence based on the 'flying disc' model, including key performance indicators (KPIs). This new model maps out the socio-economic arena of a complex urban system according to the above cascade system. The design of this urban system architecture and the complex mutual connections between its subsystems is based on the 'blowing-up' principle that originates from a methodological deconstruction-reconstruction paradigm in the social sciences. The paper advocates the systematic application of this principle to enhance the performance of smart cities, called the XXQ performance value. This study is not empirical, although it is inspired by a wealth of previous empirical research. It aims to advance conceptual and methodological thinking on principles of smart urban planning.","['Smart cities', ' Information', ' Stakeholders', ' Big data', ' Capacity', ' Capability', ' Intelligence', ' Cascade', ' Decomposition', ' Flying disc', ' Blowing-up principle', 'DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS', ' CITIZEN SCIENCE', ' CENTRAL PLACES', ' INNOVATION', ' GROWTH', ' MODULARITY', ' KNOWLEDGE', ' SEARCH', ' SIZE', ' TECHNOLOGY']",2021.0,ASIA-PAC J REG SCI,"['Business & Economics', ' Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Public Administration']","['Axel och Margaret Ax:son Johnsons Stiftelse, Sweden', 'CNCS']",False,2,False,189

In this paper, we focus on the integrated Laycan and Berth Allocation and Quay Crane Assignment Problem, which considers three main decision problems in port management in an integrated way: the Laycan Allocation Problem, the dynamic continuous Berth Allocation Problem and the time-invariant Quay Crane Assignment Problem. In a second part, the integrated problem is extended to the Specific Quay Crane Assignment, which includes the assignment of a set of specific quay cranes to each vessel, considering the productivity of quay cranes and their maximum outreach. The proposed integer programming models are original in several ways. First, the formulation of the models uses predicates which ensure flexibility in the implementation, and significantly improve the computational performance. The numerical study shows that the problems of practical size can be solved to optimality in a reasonable time using commercial software. Second, since the studied problems have different decision levels, a change of decision time-interval is incorporated inside the planning horizon for seamless decision-making. Third, to ensure that this integrated problem is as close as possible to reality, we consider both physical characteristics of the ports rarely studied together (tidal ports with multiple quays and different water depths) and contractual clauses (non-working periods and Charter Party clauses).

Radar observations, available at high resolution and with a high revisit time since the launch of Sentinel-1 in 2014, have shown great potential for the monitoring of the water content of the upper soil and of the canopy. In this paper, a complete set of data for radar signal analysis is shared with the scientific community for the first time to our knowledge.

On the Utility of High-Resolution Soil Moisture Data for Better Constraining Thermal-Based Energy Balance over Three Semi-Arid Agricultural Areas,"['Hssaine, BA', ' Chehbouni, A', ' Er-Raki, S', ' Khabba, S', ' Ezzahar, J', ' Ouaadi, N', ' Ojha, N', ' Rivalland, V', ' Merlin, O']","Over semi-arid agricultural areas, the surface energy balance and its components are largely dependent on the soil water availability. In such conditions, the land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from the thermal bands has been commonly used to represent the high spatial variability of the surface evaporative fraction and associated fluxes. In contrast, however, the soil moisture (SM) retrieved from microwave data has rarely been used thus far due to the unavailability of high-resolution (field scale) SM products until recent times. Soil evaporation is controlled by the surface SM. Moreover, the surface SM dynamics is temporally related to root zone SM, which provides information about the water status of plants. The aim of this work was to assess the gain in terms of flux estimates when integrating microwave-derived SM data in a thermal-based energy balance model at the field scale. In this study, SM products were derived from three different methodologies: the first approach inverts SM, labeled hereafter as 'SMO20', from the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence derived from Sentinel-1 products in the water cloud model (WCM); the second approach inverts SM from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data based on machine learning algorithms trained on a synthetic dataset simulated by the WCM noted 'SME16'; and the third approach disaggregates the soil moisture active and passive SM at 100 m resolution using Landsat optical/thermal data 'SMO19'. These SM products, combined with the Landsat based vegetation index and LST, are integrated simultaneously within an energy balance model (TSEB-SM) to predict the latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes over two irrigated and rainfed wheat crop sites located in the Haouz Plain in the center of Morocco. H and LE were measured over each site using an eddy covariance system and their values were used to evaluate the potential of TSEB-SM against the classical two source energy balance (TSEB) model solely based on optical/thermal data. Globally, TSEB systematically overestimates LE (mean bias of 100 W/m(2)) and underestimates H (mean bias of -110 W/m(2)), while TSEB-SM significantly reduces those biases, regardless of the SM product used as input. This is linked to the parameterization of the Priestley Taylor coefficient, which is set to alpha(PT) = 1.26 by default in TSEB and adjusted across the season in TSEB-SM. The best performance of TSEB-SM was obtained over the irrigated field using the three retrieved SM products with a mean R-2 of 0.72 and 0.92, and a mean RMSE of 31 and 36 W/m(2) for LE and H, respectively.

Hence, it is very important to understand genes associated with antioxidant activity for improving the varieties. In this study, we compared structural and functional aspects of antioxidant genes viz., APX, DHAR, MDHAR, GR, and SOD of two contrasting genotypes viz. GP-1 (low Ca2+) and GP-45 (high Ca2+) of finger millet with other cereal crops such as rice, sorghum, and foxtail millet. The structural analysis shows that all genes are conserved and shares almost the same domains such as ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, Fe, and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase domains which play a significant role in antioxidant activity and drought tolerance. These genes were mainly localized in chloroplast and cytoplasm which prove that both are the major ROS-scavenging sites. Furthermore, several putative cis-acting regulatory elements such as AuxRE, DRE, GARE, G-box, GATA-box, MBS, MYBR, and W-box are also studied and found that these genes are involved in defense mechanisms which allow responses against drought stress. Antioxidant activity of these genes was compared using expression analysis in terms of FPKM values and found that the genes of low Ca2+ genotype are highly expressed compared to the genes of high Ca2+ genotype and the genes of rice, sorghum, and foxtail millet. These results revealed that a low Ca2+ genotype of finger millet has higher antioxidant activity in comparison to high Ca2+ genotype and other cereal crops.

Therefore, new management strategies are needed to resolve and mitigate these negative consequences, improve soil quality and plant growth, and rationalize water use. In this context, we investigated the role of beneficial plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) consortium, and compost (Comp) in improving tomato growth and yield, and drought tolerance. A completely randomized design was used in this experiment with the water stress as the main factor consisting of two treatments: (1) control well-watered (WW) plants (75% field capacity (FC)) and (2) water-stressed (WS) plants (35% FC), and the fertilization as a subfactor consisting of eight treatments. Growth parameters (shoot and root dry weight, leaf number, and area), productivity (fruit number and weight), mineral content (Ca2+, Na+, K+, and P), biochemical parameters (sugar, protein, and polyphenols), and antioxidant enzyme activities (polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) were evaluated to investigate the effect of both factor. Soil physicochemical and microbial properties were examined after the experiment to assess the impact of water stress and applied biofertilizers on these parameters. Water stress affected negatively plant growth traits and yield and unbalanced the antioxidant enzymes. However, application of biofertilizers attenuated the negative effect of drought stress. For instance, a significant increase in shoot biomass of 160%, 120%, and 156% was obtained by Comp, PGPR + Comp, and AMF + Comp treatments compared to the control, respectively. Indeed, all treatments (except AMF under both conditions and PGPR + AMF + Comp under WS conditions) significantly increased the fruit number per plant. Concerning fruit yield, Comp, PGPR + Comp, AMF + Comp, PGPR, and PGPR + AMF treatments were the most effective treatments resulting in 179%, 149%, 111%, 203%, and 181% of the increment, respectively. Concerning the fruit quality, our finding showed a positive effect on sugar content and a significant decrease in the amount of polyphenol content was recorded by the different applied treatments compared to control plants under WW conditions. Under WS conditions, the PGPR significantly enhanced sugar and protein by 24% and 177%, respectively. However, they significantly decreased the polyphenol content under WS conditions by 42%. According to the antioxidant enzymes, a significant decrease in polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase activities in roots was recorded by the different applied treatment plants than WS control plants. In the shoot part, treatments with PGPR increased the catalase activity under WS conditions. PGPR + Comp, AMF + Comp, PGPR, and PGPR + AMF treatments significantly decreased the polyphenoloxidase activity and increased the peroxidase activity under WS conditions. In light of these findings, the use of compost alone or in combinations with the beneficial microorganisms (PGPR and AMF) enhanced the water stress tolerance of tomato plants by improving plant growth, osmolyte accumulation, and mineral accumulation and by decreasing the amount of antioxidant enzyme activity. This strategy could be vital to resolve and mitigate the negative consequences of drought stress and rationalize water use.","['Water stress', ' PGPR', ' AMF', ' Compost', ' Fruit quality', ' Antioxidant enzymes', ' Solanum lycopersicum L', 'ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI', ' SOLID-WASTE COMPOST', ' DROUGHT STRESS', ' DEFICIT IRRIGATION', ' PROCESSING TOMATO', ' PROMOTING TRAITS', ' OSMOTIC-STRESS', ' SANDY SOIL', ' DATE PALM', ' EXOPOLYSACCHARIDE']",,J SOIL SCI PLANT NUT,"['Plant Sciences', ' Environmental Sciences & Ecology', ' Agriculture']","['CNRST', ' Alexander von Humboldt foundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation']",False,2,False,112

For effective mitigation strategies and site selection soiling ratio data is crucial. Soiling can be measured directly by comparing the power or short circuit current of a soiled PV cell or module to that of a clean photovoltaic (PV) device of the same model. In recent years, a number of indirect soiling sensors such as Kipp and Zonen's DustIQ and Atonometric's MARS were introduced. These sensors do not use PV cells to determine the soiling ratio. Indirect soiling sensors derive soiling based on information such as particle concentration and size. The soiling loss of PV systems shows a strong angle of incidence (AOI) dependent pattern for sunny conditions. This pattern is not reproduced by indirect sensors such as DustIQ and MARS. We developed a method to adapt the soiling measurement of indirect soiling sensors using the AOI and the Linke turbidity. The adaptation is based on an analysis of the AOI dependence of the reference cell-derived soiling ratio. Linke turbidity is derived from irradiance measurements. The method reduces the root mean square error between the soiling ratios detected by the DustIQ and a colocated pair of PV reference cells from 0.7% to 0.2%.

Time series data on cacao farm yields in Sulawesi, Indonesia, with and without fertilizer, were used to provide proof-of-concept. A machine learning approach associated 75% of cacao yield variation with the ENSO patterns up to 8 and 24 months before harvest and predicted when fertilizer applications would be worthwhile. Thus, it's possible to relate average cacao crop performance and management response directly to ENSO patterns without weather data provided: (1) site specific data exist on crop performance over time with distinct management practices; and (2) the weather patterns are driven by ENSO OI.

The morphological observation and nitrogen adsorption measurement demonstrated that the extracted CMFs exhibit an average fibril diameter of 11.5 mu m and mesoporous structure with an average pore size of 6.37 nm. These special features make the as-produced CMFs excellent candidates to be used as adsorbents for removal of MB from concentrated solutions. The performed adsorption studies determined that the adsorption equilibrium was reached within 90 min. The adsorption kinetics data were well fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption isotherms were well described by the Freundlich isotherm model. In addition, the maximum adsorption capacity was 182.5 mg/g, much higher than that determined for other previously reported cellulose-based adsorbents.

The model was first calibrated and validated at plot scale using ET measured by eddy-covariance systems over wheat fields and olive orchards representing the main crops grown in the study area of the Haouz plain (central Morocco). The results showed that the model provided good estimates of ET for wheat and olive trees with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 0.56 and 0.54 mm/day respectively. The model was then used to compare remotely sensed estimates of irrigation requirements (RS-IWR) and irrigation water supplied (WS) at plot scale over an irrigation district in the Haouz plain through three growing seasons. The comparison indicated a large spatio-temporal variability in irrigation water demands and supplies; the median values of WS and RS-IWR were 130 (175), 117 (175) and 118 (112) mm respectively in the 2002-2003, 2005-2006 and 2008-2009 seasons.

The HYDRUS-1D simulations were performed at daily time step during the two growing seasons: 2002/2003 and 2015/2016. The model was firstly calibrated based on one field denoted F1 data during the 2002/2003 cropping season by using the Levenberg-Marquardt method implemented in HYDRUS-1D model for optimizing various parameters of Van Genuchten equation that provide the minimum difference between measured and simulated soil moisture at four layers of soil (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 cm).

All fields were irrigated with flooding system except the field F5 where drip irrigation was undertaken. In-situ measurements of theta was carried out using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and gravimetric method ETa was measured by the Eddy Covariance system Ta and Ea were monitored using a lysimeter in F5 field. The results showed that the HYDRUS-1D model simulates the theta, ETa, Ta and Ea reasonably well. Additionally, the evaluation of the irrigation system on DP losses was investigated by comparing the simulation results over flood (F4) and drip (F5) irrigated fields. It was found that about 56% and 20% of seasonal supplied water were lost by DP in F4 and F5 sites, respectively. Such unexpected high amount of DP taking place in F5 field is due to the improper use of the drip irrigation system.","['HYDRUS-1D', ' Evapotranspiration', ' Eddy covariance', ' Deep percolation', ' Winter wheat', 'LAND-SURFACE MODEL', ' ROOT-ZONE WATER', ' HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY', ' DEEP-PERCOLATION', ' EDDY-COVARIANCE', ' PARTITIONING EVAPOTRANSPIRATION', ' SOIL EVAPORATION', ' SONIC ANEMOMETER', ' CROPS', ' FIELD']",2021.0,AGR WATER MANAGE,"['Agriculture', ' Water Resources']","['European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [645642]', 'ACCWA', 'OCP']",True,3,False,82

Meta-analysis of yield and nitrous oxide outcomes for nitrogen management in agriculture,"['Maaz, TM', ' Sapkota, TB', ' Eagle, AJ', ' Kantar, MB', ' Bruulsema, TW', ' Majumdar, K']","Improved nitrogen (N) use is key to future food security and environmental sustainability. While many regions still experience N shortages, agriculture is the leading global emitter of N2O due to losses exacerbated by N surpluses in other regions. In order to sustainably maintain or increase food production, farmers and their advisors need a comprehensive and actionable understanding of how nutrient management affects both yield and N2O emissions, particularly in tropical and subtropical agroecosystems. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the effect of N management and other factors on N2O emissions, plant N uptake, and yield. Our analysis demonstrates that performance indicators-partial N balance and partial factor productivity-predicted N2O emissions as well as or better than N rate. While we observed consistent production and environmental benefits with enhanced-efficiency fertilizers, we noted potential trade-offs between yield and N2O emissions for fertilizer placement. Furthermore, we observed confounding effects due to management dynamics that co-vary with nutrient application practices, thus challenging the interpretation of the effect of specific practices such as fertilization frequency. Therefore, rather than providing universally prescriptive management for N2O emission reduction, our evidence supports mitigation strategies based upon tailored nutrient management approaches that keep N balances within safe limits, so as to minimize N2O emissions while still achieving high crop yields. The limited evidence available suggests that these relationships hold for temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions, but given the potential for expansion of N use in crop production, further N2O data collection should be prioritized in under-represented regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa.","['4R', ' agriculture', ' balance', ' emissions', ' management', ' N2O', ' rice', ' subtropical', ' yield']",2021.0,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,"['Biodiversity & Conservation', ' Environmental Sciences & Ecology']","['CGIAR', 'CGIAR']",False,2,False,70

The temporal dynamics of soil N is partially influenced by the N source (i.e., organic or inorganic fertilizer) and the synchrony between N supply and demand. This study, which was conducted in Colombia on soils with high organic carbon and phosphorus contents, aimed at monitoring N2O emissions from Cassava plots fertilized with organic (49.8 kg N/ha year(-1)) or inorganic fertilizers (22.7 kg N/ha year(-1)). Although the organic fertilizer (vermicompost) contained more than double the amount of N, cumulative N2O emissions from organic cassava production (1.28 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) were lower than those from inorganic fertilizer-based cassava production (1.74 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) system. This finding indicates that, if crop yields can be maintained, there is potential to reduce cassava production's environmental impact through organic fertilization on highly fertile soils. However, a transition to organic fertilization depends on the availability of sufficient amounts of organic fertilizers at the farm level.

"A Leaf Extract of Harrisonia abyssinica Ameliorates Neurobehavioral, Histological and Biochemical Changes in the Hippocampus of Rats with Aluminum Chloride-Induced Alzheimer's Disease","['Anwar, HM', ' Georgy, GS', ' Hamad, SR', ' Badr, WK', ' El Raey, MA', ' Abdelfattah, MAO', ' Wink, M', ' Sobeh, M']","Aluminum (Al) is an omnipresent mineral element in the environment. The brain is a central target of Al toxicity, being highly susceptible to oxidative damage. Therefore, recognition of drugs or natural products that guard against Al-mediated neuronal cell death is a powerful strategy for prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. This work aimed to explore the potential of a leaf extract from Harrisonia abyssinica to modulate the neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological activities induced experimentally by Al in vivo. Rats subjected to Al treatment displayed a reduction in learning and memory performance in a passive avoidance test accompanied by a decrease in the hippocampal monoamine and glutamate levels in addition to suppression of Bcl2 expression. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta), apoptotic markers (caspase-3 and expression of Bax) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) levels were elevated along with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, histological changes and marked deposition of amyloid beta plaques in the hippocampus region of the brain tissues being observed in Al-treated animals. Concomitant administration of the high dose of H. abyssinica (200 mg/kg b.w.) restored nearly normal levels of all parameters measured, rather than the low dose (100 mg/kg b.w.), an effect that was comparable to the reference drug (rivastigmine). Molecular docking revealed the appropriate potential of the extract components to block the active site of AChE and ERK2. In conclusion, H. abyssinica leaf extract conferred neuroprotection against Al-induced neurotoxic effects, most likely due to its high phenolic and flavonoid content.","['Harrisonia abyssinica', ' hippocampus', "" Alzheimer's"", ' polyphenols', ' ChE', ' ERK', ' Bcl2', 'NEUROTOXICITY', ' ANTIOXIDANT', ' BEHAVIOR', ' PATHWAY']",2021.0,ANTIOXIDANTS-BASEL,"['Biochemistry & Molecular Biology', ' Pharmacology & Pharmacy', ' Food Science & Technology']",['UMP'],False,1,True,43

The polymers resulted in a semi-interpenetrated polymer network (semi-IPN), hosting an ionic liquid (IL)/salt mixture, and thus exhibited high ionic conductivity and excellent mechanical properties. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion measurements and relaxation rates analysis highlighted the existence of interactions between Li+ ions and oxygen within the polymers, preventing electrolyte leakage and ensuring excellent mechanical strength which enabled a unique quasi-solid electrolyte. Such mechanical strength and chemical stability made this electrolyte to be first ever reported GPE to withstand thermal evaporation deposition and hence direct deposition of lithium metal. The electrolyte could be shaped as self-standing thin films, and thus worked as both separator and electrolyte in a thin-film lithium microbattery. The thin-film microbattery exhibited excellent performances showing no short-circuit current, an open circuit voltage of similar to 3.0 V, higher nominal voltage plateau, lower equivalent series resistance by comparison to a thin-film microbattery designed in conventional way with a popular ceramic electrolyte LiPON.","['Li-ion battery', ' microbattery', ' gel polymer electrolyte', ' ionic liquid', ' solid-state battery', 'IONIC-LIQUID', ' HIGH-PERFORMANCE', ' HIGH SAFETY', ' COMPOSITE', ' BATTERY', ' CONDUCTIVITY']",2021.0,BATTERIES SUPERCAPS,"['Electrochemistry', ' Materials Science']","['Region Centre Val de LoireRegion Centre-Val de Loire', ' Le Studium Loire Valley Institute for Advanced Studies', ' STMicroelectronics']",False,3,False,61

The farmers, who were divided into four groups, had all been trained in Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). Two inorganic fertilizer regimes were compared on the farms that were all supposed to be using GAP. The trials for each group were run for 2 years, with different groups monitored over distinct periods with varying weather conditions, over a 4-year period from 2013 to 2016.

Consequently, the imperfect phase knowledge at the IRS should be considered. The phase error is modeled using the von Mises distribution and the analysis is performed using the Sinusoidal Addition Theorem (SAT) to provide accurate results when the number of reflectors L <= 3, and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) when L >= 4. The achieved results show that accurate phase estimation is critical for IRS based systems, particularly for a small number of reflecting elements. For example, the SER at 10(-3) degrades by about 5 dB when the von Mises concentration parameter kappa = 2 and L = 30, but the degradation for the same kappa surges to 25 dB when L = 2. The airto-air (A2A) channel for each propagation path is modeled as a single dominant line-of-sight (LoS) component, and the results are compared to the Rician channel.

Metal and sulfur removal from petroleum oil using a novel demetallization-desulfurization agent and process,"['Attia, M', ' Farag, S', ' Jaffer, SA', ' Chaouki, J']","Removal of metals and sulfur is a challenging operation during the crude refining that often is the bottleneck thereby increasing costs and reducing overall energy efficiency. Specifically, soluble sulfur and metal compounds containing vanadium and nickel are the most difficult to manage leading to problems such as: elevated corrosion, rapid catalyst deactivation, and potential human exposure and health impacts. In this study, a novel demetallization-desulfurization process has been developed to selectively extract metals about 36 metals including vanadium and nickel from the core of the porphyrin ring without removing or destroying the ring. This novel process utilizes bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid as the demetallization-desulfurization agent (DM-DSA). The primary mechanism is that the DM-DSA acts as a proton donor and selectively removes metals from the core of the porphyrin ring, thereby permitting the oil yield to be unaffected. A further benefit is the reduction in the levels of thiophene compounds via a different extraction mechanism under the same reaction conditions.

This study investigated the modulating effect of combined microalgae-cyanobacteria extract formulations (MEF1%, MEF5%, and MEF10%) prepared from the species Dunaliella salina, Chlorella ellipsoidea, Aphanothece sp., and Arthrospira maxima, on tomato plant growth and tolerance under four NaCl concentrations (0, 80, 120, and 150 mM). MEF5% enhanced the vegetative growth of tomato plants, characterized by higher shoot and root weight and larger leaf area. According to principal component analysis (PCA), improved plant growth was closely associated with leaf photosynthetic pigments, which was mainly due to improved osmotic adjustment and ion homeostasis. Proline accumulation was significantly enhanced by MEF5%-treatment in plants grown under 120 mM and 150 mM NaCl conditions. MEF5%-treatment also significantly improved nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K+) absorption in plants grown at 80 mM and 120 mM NaCl levels. Leaf lipid peroxidation through ROS oxidative stress significantly decreased with enhanced CAT and SOD activities in MEF5%-treated plants. MEF5% triggered a significant decline in fatty acid content, indicating fatty acid transformation into other lipid forms such as alkanes, which are essential in the cuticular wax synthesis of hydric stressed plants. Enhanced K+ uptake and reduced Na+/K+ ratio in the leaves of treated plants indicate MEF's active role in reestablishing ion homeostasis. Nutrient uptake can be improved by enhanced root biomass, which subsequently increases the roots' surface for nutrient absorption. These results indicate that MEF stimulated plant growth and tolerance responses through (i) enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities and (ii) improved root growth and nutrient uptake. Therefore, combined microalgae-cyanobacteria formulations could be another sustainable alternative to boost nutrient uptake, growth, and crop adaptability under normal and saline conditions.","['Chlorophyceae', ' Cyanobacteria', ' Salt stress tolerance', ' Solanum lycopersicum', ' Plant growth', 'OXIDATIVE STRESS', ' LYCOPERSICON', ' VACUOLES', ' SYSTEMS', ' ROS']",2021.0,J APPL PHYCOL,"['Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology', ' Marine & Freshwater Biology']",['OCP'],True,1,False,74

In this work, we have characterized 37 secondary metabolites using HPLC-MS/MS, identified the polysaccharide from the fruits and cladodes pulp, and estimated the neuroprotective activity. All tested extracts exhibited substantial antioxidant activities in-vitro and neuroprotective potential in AlCl3 induced Alzheimer's condition. Administration of OFI extracts attenuated AlCl3 induced learning and memory impairment as confirmed from passive avoidance test and counteracted the oxidative stress as manifested from decreasein the elevated MDA level, increased TAC, GSH, SOD and CAT levels. OFI extracts significantly decreased the elevated brain levels of proinflammatory cytokines (NF-kappa beta and TNF-alpha), increased anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and monoamine neurotransmitters (NE, DA, 5-HT) as compared to positive control group. The extracts showed a significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase level (AChE) as compared with AlCl3.

In recent decades, the salinity of groundwater has increased, which is why geochemical techniques and environmental isotopes have been used to determine the main sources of groundwater recharge and salinization. The hydrochemical study shows that for the years 1995, 2007, 2016 and 2019, the chemical composition of groundwater in the study area consists of HCO3-Ca-Mg, Cl-Ca-Mg, SO4-Ca and Cl-Na chemical facies. The results show that from 1995 to 2019, electrical conductivity increased and that could be explained by a decrease in annual rainfall in relation to climate change and water-rock interaction processes. Geochemical and environmental isotope data show that the main geochemical mechanisms controlling the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the Cenomanian-Turonian aquifer are the water-rock interaction and the cation exchange process. The diagram of delta H-2 = 8 * delta O-18 + 10 shows that the isotopic contents are close or above to the Global Meteoric Water Line, which suggests that the aquifer is recharged by precipitation of Atlantic origin.

Humification Process and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons Assessment During Oily Sludge Composting,"['Aguelmous, A', ' El Fels, L', ' Souabi, S', ' Zamama, M', ' Lahsaini, S', ' Lebrihi, A', ' Bekkaoui, F', ' Hafidi, M']","The petroleum sludge composting in a bioreactor with green wastes was made in interest to assess the organic matter biotransformation, the total petroleum hydrocarbons biodegradation and the maturity of the final product. During the composting process the C/N and NH4+/NO3- ratios decreased to reach values of maturity for the second test B. Otherwise, the decomposition rate was found to be high for test B, as the maximal temperature reached 52 degrees C for test B while it was only 40 degrees C for test A. The humification process was monitored by the increase of the humic substance and the HA/FA ratio, and by the FTIR which demonstrated the decrease of the aliphatic group bands and the persistence of the aromatic group bands. The three analysis methods revealed a similarity in the assessment of total petroleum hydrocarbons removal, which reached a rate of 94%. The composting process had also led to a reduction of the phytotoxicity by increasing the germination index.","['Petroleum sludge', ' Composting', ' Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)', ' Humification', ' Phytotoxicity', ' Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)', 'ORGANIC-MATTER', ' REFINERY SLUDGE', ' HUMIC SUBSTANCES', ' FIELD-SCALE', ' WASTE', ' SOIL', ' BIOREMEDIATION', ' REMEDIATION', ' EXTRACTION', ' ACIDS']",2020.0,WASTE BIOMASS VALORI,['Environmental Sciences & Ecology'],[''],False,1,False,54
Genotoxicity evaluation of different types of leachate treated with Aspergillus flavus using Vicia faba micronucleus,"['Zegzouti, Y', ' Aguelmous, A', ' Khadra, A', ' Boutafda, A', ' El Fels, L', ' Hassani, LAI', ' El Hadek, M', ' Hafidi, M']","In this study, the efficiency of Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus) was studied in the treatment of three landfill leachate types, namely young, intermediate and old (YL, IL and OL) in terms of removal of organic and nitrogen matter, as well as genotoxicity. The organic fraction of landfill leachate was measured by biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the nitrogen fraction was measured by ammonium (NH4+). The genotoxicity was evaluated using the Vicia faba root-micronucleus test. The analysis of the three leachates revealed high values of COD ( 9517.4-19 523.33 mg/L), BOD5 ( 1756.8-11 600 mg/L), NH4+ ( 5931.25-3112.68 mg/L) and total chromium (CrT: 0.06-3.78 mg/L). The three leachates also showed genotoxic effect on Vicia faba cells at a 1% leachate concentration. The treatment of leachates with A. flavus led to considerable reduction of pollutant load, and it was found to be more effective in reducing COD (30.12 %) and BOD5(71.29%) in YL and NH4+ (98.21%) in IL after 30 days of treatment. A decrease in Micronucleus frequency (48.57-52.32 parts per thousand) was observed in Vicia faba cells exposed to treated OL and IL compared to raw samples, while no such reduction was observed in the treated YL. The treatment of leachate with A. flavus showed more efficiency in genotoxicity removal for OL and IL. However, treated YL still possesses genotoxic character, even if it recorded the highest COD removal rate. Thus, the evaluation of leachate bioremediation on genotoxicity removal effectiveness should be included in landfill leachate risk assessment studies in order to ensure safe levels for its disposal in the environment.

Application of Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor and Fixed Bed Hybrid Biological Reactor for Oilfield Produced Water Treatment: Influence of Total Dissolved Solids Concentration,"['Lusinier, N', ' Seyssiecq, I', ' Sambusiti, C', ' Jacob, M', ' Lesage, N', ' Roche, N']","This experimental paper deals with the development of a hybrid biological reactor for the treatment of a synthetic oilfield produced water under an increase in total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration. To comply with strengthening regulations concerning produced water discharge and peculiar produced water compositions, a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) consisting in a combination of free activated sludge and moving biofilm supports was compared to a fixed bed hybrid biological reactor (FBHBR) consisting in a combination of free activated sludge and a fixed biofilm support. After a 216 days experimental period, the MBBR and the FBHBR were efficient to treat a synthetic produced water with chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate above 90% under an increase in TDS concentrations from 1.5 to 20 g & BULL;L-1. Ecotoxicity measurements on freshwater and marine microorganisms revealed an absence of toxicity on treated waters. A decrease in bacterial diversity indices with respect to the inoculum was observed in both bioreactors. This suggests that the increase in TDS concentrations caused the predominance of a low number of bacterial species.","['oilfield produced water', ' hybrid biological reactor', ' total dissolved solids', ' bacterial diversity', 'MIXED LIQUOR CHARACTERISTICS', ' HYPERSALINE PRODUCED WATER', ' WASTE-WATER', ' ACTIVATED-SLUDGE', ' MICROBIAL COMMUNITY', ' PERFORMANCE', ' REMOVAL', ' HERPETOSIPHON', ' HYDROCARBONS', ' SYSTEMS']",2021.0,ENERGIES,['Energy & Fuels'],['SA'],False,1,False,54
Thermal stability of soil organic carbon after long-term manure application across land uses and tillage systems in an oxisol,"['Barreto, MSC', ' Ramlogan, M', ' Oliveira, DMS', ' Verburg, EEJ', ' Elzinga, EJ', ' Rouff, AA', ' Jemo, M', ' Alleoni, LRF']","The pool of carbon (C) present in soil systems is larger than the amount of organic C stored in living biomass and the atmosphere. Soil degradation has increased soil C emissions at the expense of C accumulation. Climate-smart management practices may be adapted to increase C sequestration as soil organic carbon (SOC). To avoid the SOC loss, different strategies have been applied, including no-tillage and organic fertilizer. Here, we investigated thermal stability of SOC after long-term manure application across land uses and tillage systems in weathered soils of Brazil. We chose five commercial areas with different land uses: pasture with swine manure (SM) application (PA + SM), conventional tillage (CT) with SM application (CT + SM), natural vegetation (NV), no-tillage with SM application (NT + SM), and no-tillage (NT). Thermal analysis revealed that SOC oxidation and CO2 emission started around 240 degrees C, close to gibbsite and goethite structural collapse, suggesting preferential adsorption of SOC onto these minerals. Approximately 50% of SOC for all sites was oxidizable at lower temperature (similar to 315 degrees C) which suggests the prevalence of polysaccharides, decarboxylation of acidic groups and dehydration of hydroxylate aliphatic structures, regardless of land-use. The energy content of SOC for NV (6.5) and PA + SM (10.6) were in average, 46% lower than other treatments which suggest a higher necromass contribution to SOC in these systems. However, the higher energy content in CT + SM (14.9), NT + SM (16.5), and NT (15.8), suggests a higher contribution of plant-derived compounds in SOC. Our results showed that SM application on pastureland reached similar SOC accumulation to NV and increment of similar to 33% when applied to notill system. We conclude that SM could a drive higher C accumulation and stabilization if preferentially associated to soil conservative system.","['Ferralsol', ' Thermogravimetry', ' Soil organic carbon persistence', ' No-tillage', ' Grassland']",2021.0,CATENA,"['Geology', ' Agriculture', ' Water Resources']","['FAPESP', 'CAPES', 'CNPQ']",False,3,False,88
